__label__m And  our  pain  treatment  system  got  horribly  broken  when  some  stupid  college  kids  started  using  Grandma's  OxyContin  as  nose  candy,  about  15-20  years  ago.  As  is  typical,  our  government  WILDLY  overreacted,  and  the  media  fed  the  melodrama,  because  opiates  are  the  new  Casey  Anthony!!!
__label__m so  i  guess  adderall  is  only  safe  if  you  have  a  piece  of  paper  from  a  doctor  telling  you  to  take  it,  otherwise  its  a  killer  illegal  drug

__label__c _U  _U  1)  At  my  monthly  pain  doctor  visit,  he  asked  me  how  my  pain  was.  It’s  always  about  a  5,  even  after  2  surgeries  and  a  spinal  cord  stimulator.  I  have  been  on  oxycodone  since  2012.  I  take  just  enough  to  manage  the  pain.  I  haven’t  increased  dosage  in  the  last  2  years.

__label__m This  is  one  of  the  most  factually  inaccurate  articles  I've  read  in  ages.    MDs  aren't  aware  of  non-opioid  pain  meds?  Is  that  why  Humira,  Enbrel,  SSRIs,  Lyrica,  NSAIDS,  etc.  are  best  selling  meds  of  all  time?    The  claim  that  doctors  rarely  prescribe  non-opiates  for  pain  is  false.

From  reading  the  experience  of  so  many  ppl  in  FB  groups  and  coming  off  opioids  and  Suboxone  it  appeared  that  they  often  needed  more  bc  of  how  opioids,  Suboxone,  and  Kratom  work  on  the  receptors?

__label__u _U    Lyrica,  just  checked  out  "Runaways"  to  kill  the  weekend  and  got  hooked.  Dude,  you  totally  MAKE  that  show.  I'm  all  in.!  For  all  you  contribute...seriously,  just  Thank  You!
__label__m Stupid  how  they  still  locking  people  up  and  put  on  probation  for  marijuana.  It's  not  a  fucking  drug.  Xanax  is.  Adderall  is.  Fuckin  doctors
__label__c I’m  in  so  much  pain  that  morphine  didn’t  help
__label__u pull  in  to  my  parking  lot  ,  jump  in  to  my  ride😜😜😜  lyrica  anderson
__label__c _U  it  makes  me  so  nauseated  &  headachey  i'm  sure  other  effects  are  suppressed.  hydrocodone  -  smooooooth.
__label__m _U  If  they  are  providing  morphine  therapy  for  pain  hold  on  to  any  alert  moments  you  can.  God  bless!
__label__a i  probably  should  of  took  a  vyvanse  before  work😩
__label__a wanna  kiss  dick  and  snort  xanax  all  day
__label__m _U  _U  You  are  correct.  The  whole  exchange  bw  both  parties  is  tense.  I  feel  like  we  missed  some  dialogue  prior  to  the  video.  You  can  overhear  the  man  already  has  a  prescription  for  klonopin  so  this  is  not  a  first  time  experience  I’m  sure.
__label__m Have  an  extra  toe?You  probably  have  Premature  Ejaculations.This  causes  hallucinations.Try  Methadone
__label__a Currently  rocking  albuterol,  tramadol,  ondansetron,  prozac,  and  guaifenesin  with  codeine.  I  feel  very  weird  but...  comfortable?  I  think?  Zzzzzzz.
__label__a _U  u  failed  to  mention  u  can  die  from  methadone  overdose  too.  Methadone  is  just  as  dangerous.  My  family  has  been  haunted  by  a  loved  ones  opioid  addiction  and  methadone  made  it  worse.    #EnoughIsEnough    #KnowTheFacts  #Weed4
__label__u _U  Smartwater  by  Lyrica  Anderson!
__label__a literally  who  has  a  xanax  for  this  boy  i'm  about  to  burn  something
__label__c I  hate  that  Abilify  causes  blurry  vision  :/
__label__m how  should  you  take  xanax
__label__a adderall  had  me  redecorating  my  room  organizing  everything  in  separate  boxes  and  doing  everything  except  my  schoolwork
__label__m _U  Xanax  does  the  job...
__label__c oxycodone  be  putting  in  work  lol  #medsforpain
__label__m OxyContin  prescriptions  for  noncancer  pain  grew  10x  between  1997  and  2002,  long  before  the  A.C.A.  was  signed  into  law  There's  a  deeper  issue
__label__c morphine  all  inside  of  me  im  throwin  up  i  can't  feel  peace
__label__c I  have  absolutely  no  recollection  of  ordering  this  stuff.  Morphine  is  a  hell  of  a  drug.
__label__c zane  just  told  me  i'm  too  pretty  to  take  adderall
__label__m _U  _U  i  just  think  comparing  it  to  morphine  is  a  stretch.  think  about  that.
__label__m Tonights  episode  of  Bellend  Street  was  brought  to  you  by  the  emojis  💃  👩‍🚀  and  the  pharmecutical  Diazepam
__label__m have  hot  flashes?you  probably  have  bipolar.this  causes  blood  clots.try  abilify
__label__u _U  _U  That’s  one  of  my  favorites!  I  also  love  Almost  Had  Me,  Morphine,  and  Until  the  Light  😇
__label__m Have  frequent  anger?You  probably  have  Alcohol  addiction.This  causes  closing  of  the  throat.Try  Methadone
__label__m jenny  and  hayley  need  to  take  a  xanax  your  nagging  is  not  attractive  #tar  #amazingrace  #blinddate
__label__c missed  my  olanzapine  for  about  5  nights,  not  feelin  any  ill  effects
__label__c _U  A5:  They  improve  my  quality  of  life  so  much  esp  gabapentin.  Most  days  my  pain  is  bearable  at  a  4-5.  #SpoonieChat
__label__m _U  Get  excited  for  the  morphine
__label__m _U  Excellent  reporting  ,    flawed  response  by  FMOH.  There  is  Pregabalin,Cocodamol,  Tramadol,  pentazocin,  pethidine,  Fentanyl,  mophine,  Rohypnol,  Diazepam  ,  bromazepam  ,  Amitryptilin  ,  ketamine,  petrol,glue,Lizard  poop  etc  are  they  going  to  ban  those  as  well?#buildsystems
__label__a i  stopped  because  i  started  eating  xanax  and  forgot  to  do  everything  i  was  doing  besides  eat  xanax  and  listen  to  visual  kei
__label__m _U    justice  pointing  out  you  do  no  that  your  meant  to  spank  the  prostituting  methadone  addict  junkie  not  the  reporter  of  crime.
__label__m one  of  my  professors  just  said  "it's  going  to  be  a  xanax  weekend"  #barredout
__label__c If  being  on  amitriptyline  and  pregabalin  doesn’t  stop  my  pain  will  anything  ever  work
__label__m y'all  still  be  taking  xanax  🤔  can't  relate..  🙄
__label__c my  god  xanax  tastes  like  shit
__label__m _U  Dang,  who  did  her  spinal  tap,  housekeeping?  Seriously  tho,  legit  wuestio:  why  not  Gapapentin  or  Lyrica  and  backing  off  the  Dilaudid?
__label__m if  you  smoke  weed  to  make  you  lax  and  then  take  adderall  which  makes  you  more  active  does  it  just  counteract  and  you  become  normal
__label__c _U  you  can  try  getting  a  sleep  study  done  to  figure  it  out.  I  have  a  similar  problem.  My  meds  (Xanax  specifically)  make  it  worse.  😴
__label__c After  I  was  discharged  from  the  surgical  hospital  today  I  still  had  a  good  amount  of  morphine  in  my  system  and  when  the  lady  at  Panera  told  me  they  were  out  of  chocolate  chip  bagels  I  started  flat  out  sobbing
__label__c i  haven't  taken  my  vyvanse  in  a  month  or  more.  i  wonder  how  tweaked  out  i'd  be  if  i  did  lol  little  energizer  bunny  teresa
__label__c _U  Yeah  I  get  that  as  well  but  mainly  exhaustion.  I  took  a  diazepam  which  really  helps.  X
__label__c hopefully  this  klonopin  makes  me  forget  about  everything  for  at  least  a  little  while
__label__c Small  downside  of  Xanax.  Too  long  in  the  waiting  room,  and  I  really  want  a  nap.
__label__m _U  lyrica  is  pregabalin?  what's  the  generic  name  of  topomax?
__label__m Sada  Baby  Got  All  Y’all  Dumb  Asses  Thinking  It’s  A  Such  Thing  As  PERCOCET  30mg  When  Its  Not  The  Highest  PERCOCET  IS  10mg.  But  It’s  A  Such  Thing  As  OXYCODONE  30mg  Smart  Asses.
__label__m _U  Okay,  did  you  snort  some  Adderall  or  something?    Good  God,  you  do  go  on.    If  you  ever  want  an  adult  discussion  about  where  our  collective  morality  comes  from  and  specifically,  why  you  think  you  know  everything  and  I  don't...  let  me  know.        Otherwise,  no  reason  to  continue.
__label__m _U  _U  3)  _U  or  _U  no  1  in  Congress  talks  about  getting  the  OxyContin  Sackler  Purdue,McKesson,Teva  lobby  $  20-30  billion  Profits  back  to  pay  for  US    #OpioidEpidemic  disaster,  not  even  indicting  well  known  Middle  East  chemists  working  w/  Xiamen,Zhejiang  fentanyl  labs
__label__m OxyContin  also  shows  the  problem  of  badly  crafted  medical  studies  with  too  few  of  participants  in  the  cohort.
__label__c _U  i'm  on  that  and  also  tramadol  but  sadly  they  don't  do  much  but  take  the  edge  off  for  me  😞  thank  you  for  the  suggestion  tho!xx
__label__m _U  Pretty  much  ever  since  I  started  working  at  that  methadone  clinic  and  was  working  2  jobs  back  in  2012.
__label__c i  miss  xanax  i  liked  myself  better  when  i  couldn't  feel  anything
__label__a _U  whats  wrong  ?  &  yea  took  2  oxycodone  ,    &  2  perkenset  &lt;  whatever  that  is  lol
__label__c my  adderall  wore  off  i'm  pissed
__label__m _U  You're  going  to  need  Xanax,  scotch  and  to  assume  the  fetal  position....shall  we  begin?
__label__a _U  I  couldn't  face  watching,  I  don't  have  enough  vodka  or  valium  to  cope.
__label__m Oxycodone  for  those  oxy  morons
__label__m _U  i'm  klonopin
__label__m _U  is  this  about  lemonade  mouth  it's  on  netflix.  become  me.  cry,  take  adderall  and  xanax,  then  watch  that
__label__m _U  I  have  a  t-shirt  for  #funmoms  "Don't  talk  to  me  until  I've  had  my  morning  Xanax"
__label__a might  needa  stop  doing  pain  killers  for  fun.  i  already  have  a  high  tolerance,  no  reason  i  should  be  on  this  much  morphine  &  still  conscious.
__label__a _U  FACT:  If  not  for  bud,  I  would  have  never  freed  myself  from  oxycodone.
__label__a bitch  this  the  wrong  time  im  off  some  xanax  😩
__label__a **does  another  line  of  adderall  **  this  is  for  you  twitter    smash  that  gay  pride  button  like  a  homo  head  on  a  curb.
__label__m _U  I’m  OK  with  the  death  penalty  for  executives  of  pharmaceutical  companies  that  make  Fentanyl  and  OxyContin
__label__c Forgot  my  hydrocodone  at  home  now  I  have  to  suffer  at  work  😭
__label__m _U  Quetiapine,  lamotrigin,  clonazepam  and  venlafaxine
__label__m sinequan  or  seroquel  rt  _U:  any  drug  i  can  take  to  knock  me  out  until  kickoff?
__label__m xanax  and  alcohol...not  about  that  life.
__label__c i  quit  cigs,  my  adderall  prescription,  antianxieties  &  antidepressants  all  within  a  year..  i  can  drink  some  damn  wine  if  i  feel  like  it.
__label__m _U  _U  So  the  Drs  want  to  take  the  little  girl  off  morphine  even  though  she  IS  IN  PAIN  yet  we  hear  of  many  EOL  stories  were  allegedly  pts  are  put  on  morphine  who  were  not  in  pain  or  even  dying  but  yet  it  was  used.    They  also  said  she  wouldn't  live  to  5yrs  and  she's  now  11yrs
__label__a i  heined  myself  so  hard  today    all  adderall  and  vyvanse  is  at  home  😩
__label__a thank  u  for  showing  me  the  wonders  of  adderall  _U  ily
__label__c _U  I  have  to  carry  Diazepam  with  me  all  the  time.  I  never  use  it,  but  it’s  a  safety  net.  Kinda  like  a  Condom....it’s  better  to  have  it  and  not  need  it  than  bla  bla  bla....not  that  I  carry  condoms  but  you  know  what  I  mean.  Gonna  stop  talking  now.  😝
__label__c "💓"  that's  how  my  heart  feels  when  i'm  on  adderall
__label__m _U  _U  Well,  they  don't  do  any  research.    Get  whipped  to  a  frenzy  pretty  easily.    I  would  support  a  bill  to  hand  out  free  Valium  to  all  of  tRump  supporters.      Call  it,  tRump  super  white  pills.
__label__c shoutout  to  the  hydrocodone  for  making  me  forget  i  even  have  stitches  or  pain
__label__c _U  know  that  well  but  resorted  to  valium  the  other  day!  just  take  it  steady  x
__label__m I  wonder  how  much  klonopin  Elon  has  taken  today
__label__a I  Gotta  lot  of  lean  dats  in  my  cup,  ah  lot  kush  dats  n  my  blunt,  cause  I  been  smokin  tryna  take  dis  pain  away  ,  drinking  hen  until  da  very  last  drop,  a  lot  of  Xanax  I  done  popped,  still  my  problems  they  ain’t  never  Fade  away  🤦🏾‍♂️
__label__m I  need  a  freaky  my  drink,  and  a  Xanax.    #Red
__label__m could  i  just  find  a  vyvanse  alternative  orrrr  .....
__label__c _U  morphine  does  for  me,  bc  concentration  etc
__label__m _U  _U  Vanilla  vodka  Valium  latte.  Large  please.
__label__m "it's  sick  how  doctors  put  ppl  on  antidepressants  and  xanax  to  get  them  to  behave"  actually  Katie  Ⓥ,  people  physically  need  those  drugs  to  feel  normal.  But  if  you  have  a  suspicion  of  the  government  subjugating  vulnerable  people,  you  should  check  out  Capitalism™
__label__c _U  That  stuff  did  nothing  for  me.  Been  on  citalopram  for  a  while  but  switching  to  something  else  on  Monday.  Starts  with  the  letter  'V'...  Can't  wait  the  name.  Along  with  a  short  course  of  diazepam.  I  just  want  weed  and  about  £50000  and  I'll  be  cured.
__label__m _U  _U  When  my  father  was  dying  of  brain  and  lung  cancer  my  two  younger  sisters  went  bananas  because  I  let  him  have  more  than  one  Ativan  a  day.  Same  reason.  He'd  get  addicted.  I  no  longer  speak  to  them.
__label__m _U  I  didn’t  even  take  a  diazepam  they  have  no  reason  to  be  that  big
__label__m _U  he's  executing  cloward-piven  on  steroids,  adderall  and  crack.
__label__a And  I'm  back  in  hospital  high  as  fuck  on  morphine
__label__m #LivePD  She’s  on  methadone.    Is  the  Opioid  War  just  going  after  pills?    Why  are  we  paying  for  methadone  when  it’s  just  like  heroin?    We  have  heroin  deaths  daily  in  our  county.    No  exaggeration.
__label__m 1st  and  goal  and  here  we  are...      I  need  a  xanax
__label__m _U  "Take  a  Xanax"  =  Ableism.  Xanax  is  used  to  treat  anxiety.  Amanda  serves  a  veritable  cocktail  of  bigotry.
__label__c mmm  the  hydrocodone  is  fuccing  me  up.  time  to  sleep
__label__m _U  next  security  question:    how  many  mg  of  xanax  do  you  take  a  week?
__label__c _U  I  get  daily  debilitating  migraines.  Lavender  essential  oils  can  help  you  disassociate  from  your  pain.  Darkness,  gabapentin,  acupuncture  really  helps  too.  It's  important  to  understand  the  reason  for  why  they  are  happening.  Could  be  nerve,  tension,  stress.  Feel  better!💙
__label__m people  who  take  xanax  are  unpredictable.
__label__m i  don't  know  if  i  need  morphine  or  whisky  but  either  one  id  take  in  a  heartbeat
__label__a i  wanna  pop  some  tramadol  so  bad

__label__m _U  i  heard  morphine  helps,  somewhat.
__label__c nights  like  this  make  me  want  to  just  give  up.  taking  another  half  dose  of  morphine  and  praying  really  hard  for  unconsciousness.  #painsomnia
__label__m That's  why  you  don't  fuck  with  bitches  who  do  Xanax  and  steal  with  they're  lame  ass  boyfriend
__label__c lost  my  whole  backpack  but  honestly  all  i  need  is  my  adderall  and  car  keys  ☹️

__label__m Baby  girl  forgot  ya  like  i  ate  a  xanax  bar
__label__c 1st  time  in  hospital  for  me.  I've  had  12  hr  trolley  wait  for  a  bed,  the  special  powers  of  morphine,  a  nurse  that  got  me  an  eye  mask  to  ease  photophobia  another  made  me  laugh  &  one  that  went  beyond  to  get  TTOs  so  I  could  go  home.  It's  the  little  things  that  count  #nursesareawesome

__label__a my  cousin  just  told  me  the  only  reason  she  got  into  medical  school  was  adderall
__label__u A1  and  Lyrica's  relationship  &gt;&gt;&gt;
__label__m _U  and  we  are  supposed  to  believe  youre  going  to  fix  a  patient  you  have  already  declared  dead  and  just  give  morphine  to?
__label__m this  would  be  the  time  to  go  to  the  toilet,  smoke  a  cigarette,  or  take  some  valium  #eurovision
__label__c One  time  I  lost  22  pounds  from  throwing  up  and  not  eating  bc  my  doctors  gave  me  morphine  and  I  was  allergic  so  it  irritated  my  stomach...  🤦🏼‍♀️  a  bitch  was  115  pounds  going  in,  then  93  coming  out.

__label__c omg  i  really  don't  wanna  go.  i'm  sooooo  tired.  and  them  damn  adderall  don't  wake  me  up  either.
__label__m _U  nigga,  you  late  xanax  was  the  wave  in  like  2015,  and  that  shits  lame  anyway

__label__c _U  nah  i  am  ok,  it's  for  painkilling  not  the  high  (fortunately  it's  just  oxycodone  so  that's  basically  all  i'm  getting)
__label__m I  graduated  high  school  in  2015  so  why  did  I  just  wake  up  from  a  dream  where  I  had  to  host  the  graduation  after  party  at  my  parents’  house.  Planning  a  party  with  675  guests  is  so  stressful.  I  need  a  Xanax  after  that  dream.  😩

__label__c I've  seen  shows  lately  like  Elementary  talk  about  the  negative  effects  of  neurontin  also  known  as  gabapentin.  I  have  a  suspicion  there  maybe  something  to  a  concern  since  my  several  years  on  the  drug  proved  to  be  quite  detrimental  to  my  health  despite  its  pain-relieving  abilities.

__label__c getting  stressed  out  on  adderall  is  not  fun.  at  all.
__label__m And  my  stance  on  chronic  pain  medication  (which  seems  to  be  the  subject  of  the  day)  is  this:  daily  doses  over  60  morphine  equivalents  are  proven  to  be  dangerous  in  terms  of  respiratory  suppression  and  death,  so  I  try  to  get  people  functional  below  that.

__label__m _U  You  can,  with  Xanax  and  alcohol.  Jk  don’t  do  that...ever.
__label__c _U  I  take  Adderall  for  the  same  reason.    The  first  couple  of  weeks  are  very  different  from  how  it  usually  manifests  -  I  was  hyper  for  two  weeks  and  then  things  calmed  and  I  definitely  had  focus  and  concentration.    How  long  have  you  been  on  it?
__label__c MRI  on  Sunday  means  being  paranoid  and  replacing  my  piercings  with  plastic.  Also  my  dr  suggested  popping  a  Valium  beforehand  but  it’s  NYE  I’m  all  conflicted...
__label__m _U  Honest  to  God,  could  you  be  anymore  transparent?  Always  ends  up  badly??  Not  smart?  You  are  grasping  frantically,  desperately  at  straws.  Suggestion?  Take  a  Valium  &  Go  nighty-night  early  tonight.

__label__c _U  _U  Yup  living  in  Massachusetts  there  law  reads  it  is  for  addicts  to  get  off  highly  addictive  drugs  which  is  stupid  buprenorphine  used  correctly  can  ease  pain  and  depression  I  use  it  myself  whatever  works  should  be  the  bottom  line
__label__c Yo  fuk  Gabapentin  my  head  feels  like  it’s  full  of  rocks
__label__m _U  cocaine  and  heroin  are  not  the  same  -  heroin  is  the  morphine  molecule  (opioid),  cocaine  is  a  stimulant
__label__a chelsea  gave  me  valium  at  work  and  i  had  no  idea  until  after  i  took  it

I  still  use  the  ibuprofen,  but  have  added  gabapentin  &  cymbalta  which  have  helped  me  manage  the  neck  pain,  as  long  as  my  activity  is  limited.  Not  a  way  to  live  though.

__label__m _U  Not  only  that,  it  is  a  retrospective  study  using  the  entire  health  record.  The  use  of  subcutaneous  morphine  and  midazolam  correlates  very  well  with  mortality,  but  I  don’t  need  a  RNN  to  tell  me  that...

__label__m _U  the  key  is  to  sprinkle  adderall  on  it  instead  of  parmesan  cheese
__label__c i  even  have  one  of  the  medications  scratched  off  since  i  already  take  900mg  of  gabapentin  a  day
__label__m _U  I'd  bet  there  is  some  sort  of  medication  on  board.  Gabapentin  can  be  a  wonderful  thing  for  our  stressed  out  feline  friends.

__label__m Fuck  anxiety.  Take  xanax
__label__c _U  thanks  what  i'm  using.  my  other  pills  don't  do  anything  except  for  my  xanax  and  klonopin.

__label__c Is  this  Xanax  gonna  kick  in  and  knock  me  tf  out  or  what?
__label__c Yes  I  fucking  take  Xanax  for  my  legitimate  PTSD...  that  doesn’t  make  me  a  crackhead.  I  go  to  therapy  learning  ways  to  cope  so  1  day  I  don’t  need  the  pills.  You  think  you’re  anyone  to  judge  me  on  how  I  handle  my  situation  the  way  I  do???  Fuck  you  and  stay  the  fuck  away  JAYSON

__label__m OFGS-do  these  politicians  ranting  about  opiate  abuse  have  even  the  slightest  clue  that  THEY  are  costing  the  American  tax  payers  a  fortune  for  drugs  that  don't  work?  I  got  my  Ins.  breakdown  today.MSContin-15$.  Lyrica-599$.  They  need  to  know  what  Big  Pharma  is  doing!

__label__c Took  full  dose  of  #Lyrica  (low  dose  for  TMJ)  &  actually  felt  worse  (pain  spike  &  very  drowsy)  ironic  since  it's  supposed  to  help  pain  🤦‍♀️
__label__a the  small  price  you  pay  to  have  people  leave  you  alone  is  adderall  at  1am
__label__a I'd  still  rather  pop  xanax  than  dunk  alc
__label__m _U  Lmao  call  me  when  you're  on  the  floor  with  rocky  votolato  and  a  handful  of  flintstone's  chewable  morphine,  guy
__label__m _U  sorry  to  hear  that....sending  hydrocodone  hugs  your  way  😭
__label__c #tramadol  only  takes  the  edge  off.    Enough  to  where  the  #pain  is  bearable/tolerable....  but  even  this  is  barely  working  now.
__label__c sleeping  pills  +  hydrocodone  hmm  ok
__label__m have  an  explosive  temper?you  probably  have  depression.this  causes  failure.try  adderall
__label__a jordan  trying  to  take  a  line  eh  tramadol  in  the  library  😂
__label__c So  basically  my  hospital  thinks  doping  me  up  on  morphine  is  solving  the  issues  I  have  🙄
__label__m i  just  find  it  so  sad  how  fast  doctors  are  willing  to  throw  a  child  on  adderall  bc  of  their  "hyper  behavior."  #wtf  #what?
__label__a if  anybody  has  adderall  /  vyvanse.  please  let  me  know.

__label__a you  were  supposed  to  give  me  xanax  but  you're  scared  of  losing  your  job.  therefore  i  don't  particularly  like  you  😂

__label__m probably  back  down  claiming  she  had  forgotten  to  take  her  Midol  tablets  with  a  valium  chaser  &  didn't  want  to  ruin  her  $100  manicure.  Ironic,  isn't  it?  What  is  more  ironic  is  that  she  doesn't  even  realize  the  irony.  Their  actions  speak  so  loudly  I  cant  hear  a  damn  thing  they  say
__label__c adderall  puts  me  in  the  worst  moods..

__label__m _U  _U  _U  Was  listening  to  the  6th  song  thinking  it's  got  to  get  better.  Felt  like  I  had  taken  valium  and  wanted  to  take  some  more.

__label__m we  may  not  understand  it,  but  it's  a  reality:  methadone  doesn't  typically  involve  constantly  escalating  dose  &  many  pain  pts  find  relief  at  same  dose  for  years.  maintenance  couldn't  work  if  tolerance  to  intoxication  didn't  occur,  but  tolerance  to  other  effects  is  very  variable!
__label__m _U  _U  it's  not  futures  fault.    rappers  been  talking  bout  xanax  for  years  "xan  wit  that  lean  bitch"
__label__c i  want  a  pizza  and  my  vyvanse  asap  people
__label__m some  people  are  ignorant  as  fuck.  it’s  so  insane  how  many  people  hate  diego  for  the  decisions  some  fans  make.  you  clearly  fucking  KNOW  that  all  he  tries  doing  is  promoting  an  anti  xanax  movement  and  if  some  people  wanna  be  dumb  ass  fuck  and  still  take  xanax  oh  well  that’s  on  them

__label__a Next  time  I  take  Xanax,  I'll  make  sure  to  drink  the  bottles  first,  so  I  don't  black  out  before  I  drink  enough  to  make  my  heart  stop.
__label__c just  stared  at  my  nose  for  a  solid  37  minutes.  adderall  had  me  like....  👃
__label__m s/o  to  my  dog  for  taking  it  upon  himself  to  eat  vyvanse  at  1  am  and  keep  me  up  all  night
__label__m _U  btw  -  tv  teddy  is  one  of  the  refs  tonight.    take  a  valium  now.  lol
__label__m I  just  want  to  smack  tf  out  of  somebody  and  tell  them  to  quit  fucking  with  Xanax  but  they'd  beat  my  ass  lol
__label__a don't  worry  gang,  i  took  enough  xanax  so  in  a  few  minutes  i  won't  even  care!
__label__m I  swear  I  need  a  klonopin....I  would  settle  for  a  xan  at  this  point....  gah  dammit  I  gotta  get  insurance

__label__c 5/I  pulled  or  popped  something  in  my  shoulder  doing  the  most  mundane  of  household  chores.    I  was  in  excruciating  pain  and  Ed  took  me  to  the  ER.      I  had  3  cardiac  episodes  after  getting  morphine,  one  of  which  I  flatlined  for  10  seconds.
__label__m _U  i  bet  rubio  is  relieved  to  get  reacquainted  with  some  downers  after  being  hopped  up  on  the  adderall  for  so  long.

__label__u Well  now  I  want  to  make  a  cleric  named  Xanax  and  their  signature  move  is  to  cast  Calm  Emotions.  Imma  do  this.  #dnd  #calm
__label__m _U  Oh  my  god  so  much  is  happening...so  much...it’s  overwhelming.  Take  a  klonopin  first  for  your  own  good.
__label__m _U  _U  It’s  not  about  absorption  rates  or  which  drug  is  stronger.  Methadone  has  a  much  longer  half-life.  An  infant  would  receive  a  minuscule  dosage,  obviously.
__label__m _U  Thangoingk  you  😘😘    I'm  a  million  percent  gonna  have  to  take  a  Xanax  before  I  go  🤣
__label__c also  i  didn't  take  my  vyvanse  until  about  12:30/1ish  so  i'll  probably  be  up  at  least  until  3...
__label__c I’m  on  10/325  Hydrocodone,  every  4  hours  (6  a  day)  PLUS  a  50mcg/hr  Fentanyl  patch  (every  three  days).  That  is  just  about  right  for  me.  I  do  get  break-through  pain,  but  usually  not  so  bad  I  can’t  deal  with  it.  I  was  on  4/day  while  on  Medicaid  briefly  (their  max).  That  sucked.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  What  could  go  wrong  with  side  effects  of  abuse  of  Adderall?  Sleep  &  mental  health  issues.    ...  Err,  did  they  want  to  stay  focused  and  be  awake  longer?
__label__m used  the  bathroom  &  a  nurse  started  yelling  at  me  that  i  wasn't  doing  anything  and  i  should  clock  out  like...  looks  like  u  need  the  ativan

__label__m I’m  happy  to  say  I’ve  never  touched  coffee,  adderall  or  anything  like  that  for  school  lol
__label__c _U  30  minutes  into  xanax  and  chill  like
__label__c My  teeth  are  so  fragile  though.  Adderall  makes  my  mouth  too  dry,  I  always  end  up  with  cavities  and  it’s  so  upsetting  because  I  do  everything  right
__label__u Lyrica  is  very  talented.  I  really  hope  her  career  pops  off.  #LHHH
__label__m nod'n  off  on  a  xanax      get  pissed  off  start  air'n  it
__label__c took  adderall  today  and  it's  got  my  sleep  schedule  all  fucked  up
__label__c my  cat  cured  my  anxiety  by  being  extremely  beautiful  and  soft  and  doing  the  smallest  purrs.  either  that  or  it  was  the  klonopin
__label__m _U  They  jumped  on  the  bandwagon  due  to  pressure  put  on  them  by  some  wealthy  powerful  ppl  #garymendell  and  a  pathological  liar  that  wanted  to  sell  #suboxone  #andrewkolodny
__label__a The  only  things  getting  me  through  work  today  are  going  to  be  my  Vyvanse  and  caffeine.
__label__m _U  _U  I'd  need  a  valium  the  size  of  a  VW  Beatle  4  it  2  do  any  good.

__label__m when  someone  puts  down  the  adderall  card  in  cards  against  humanity  and  everyone  looks  at  you  true
__label__m _U  😂😂😂😂  you  sleep  the  whole  day  smfh.  I  tell  you  say  that  grade  =  Valium
__label__m _U  Fake  news,  diazepam  works  to  cause  relaxion  and  allows  a  patient  with  anxiety  to  be  calmer

__label__c have  to  say  the  paramedics  were  great  that  helped  at  home  and  on  way  to  hospital  but  now  feel  left  in  a&e..  as  we  had  the  morphine
__label__c watching  the  simpsons  while  on  morphine  is  amazing
__label__c _U  that  would  be  great-  i'm  downscaling  my  gabapentin  &  i  think  it's  making  me  feel  like  crap  wrapped  in  fuzz  w  a  cotton  brain
__label__a we  have  to  give  her  tramadol  and  she  is  very  high  lol  ☹️
__label__a i  remember  the  first  time  i  ran  into  xanax  was  at  freestone  like  4  years  ago  dude  was  tryna  sell  me  some  n  now  i  see  that  shit  everywhere
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Hopefully  he  helps  you  get  off  OxyContin  soon.  That’s  a  lot  more  important  for  his  base,  and  will  help  with  your  delusions  of  grandeur
__label__u Lyrica  junior  girl  what  the  fuck  is  you  doing  #lhhh
__label__m you  don't  "need"  adderall  but  your  doctors/psychologist  love  subscribing  it  to  your  children  who  have  to  now  take  it  daily.
__label__m _U  _U  Thanks  for  posting.  Mom’s  in  the  hospital  with  a  massive  spinal  tumor,  morphine  only  thing  that  comes  close  to  touching  her  pain.  Sharing  helps  mentally  and  emotionally.

__label__a When  I  take  a  klonopin  am  I  getting  high?  Or  am  I  getting  relief?
__label__c _U  true  and  cheaper  too.    though  the  jim  beam  has  never  helped  the  pain,  the  lyrica  did  nor  the  allergies
__label__m has  your  wholesaler  been  getting  controlled  drug  deliveries  wrong?  a  colleague  tells  me  of  getting  an  outer  of  methadone  instead  of  one  box
__label__c _U  I  have  spondylolesthesis.  I  pay  a  fortune  for  Lyrica.  I  never  abused  my  Norco.  It  was  inexpensive  though.  Hysingla  costs  much  more.
__label__m tramadol?  bro,  wtf?  i  know  better.
__label__m #CODEINE  has  been  ban,  but  there  are  other  drugs  even  more  dangerous  or  as  dangerous  as  CODEINE.  What  about  #TRAMADOL?    What  about  #MENSTROGEN?  What  about  #POSTINOR?  MESTROGEN  and  POSTINOR  are  Abortion  pills  and  these  drugs  has  been  abuse  by  young  girls,
__label__c this  drug  they  gave  me  is  making  me  feel  so  wasted.  seroquel  is  like  being  massively  wasted.
__label__u ain't  nobody  bullying  you  lyrica    girl  bye  👋🏽  #LHHH
__label__c praise  the  lord  that  morphine  got  rid  of  my  migraine

__label__c _U  it's  my  day  off  tomorrow  huggy  my  breakfast  involves  2  tramadol  a  glass  of  water  and  a  lot  of  regrets  😂
__label__a i  haven't  been  to  sleep  since  i  got  off  work  last  night  at  11.  and  i'm  currently  omw  to  an  8  hour  shift😅  thank  god  for  adderall

__label__m “_U:  adderall  had  me  climbing  mt  everest  and  singing  "aint  no  mountain  highhh  enough"  at  the  top”  _U
__label__c I  just  saw  Bear’s  phone  on  the  table  and  texted  him  to  tell  him  that  he  forgot  it.....  it’s  time  for  me  to  take  my  adderall
__label__m _U  Forget  codine  with  that  crap  playing  id  need  morphine  to  get  rid  of  the  ear  ache
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Stop  foaming  at  the  mouth  there  Zoe.  Take  a  Xanax  and  relax.
__label__c I  was  originally  diagnosed  the  same  way  (in  the  ER  with  tight  chest  etc)  when  I  was  in  college....        it  may  be  worth  trying  a  milder  benzo  like  klonopin.    Xanax  was  harsh,  but  klonopin  really  helped.    don't  have  to  take  all  the  time,  but  will  def  appreciate  having  when  needed.
__label__m i  have  done  3  questions  on  tourette's  syndrome  today.  and  i  still  dont  know  what  you  use  to  treat  it.  one  said  haloperidol,  the  other  said  aripiprazole,  and  another  source  says  pimozide.  last  week  tetrabenazine  was  the  answer.  im  confused
__label__m how  does  adderall  work  if  you  actually  have  adhd?
__label__c _U  i  believe  you  and  that  let's  me  sleep  at  night.  well,  that  and  an  ativan  but  mostly  i  believe  you.
__label__c _U  Have  you  come  off  any  painkillers  ?  I  was  the  same  after  stopping  Tramadol.  It  does  get  better  👍
__label__m our  pharmacist  has  been  gone  for  20  minutes  i  guess  its  time  to  try  oxycodone
__label__m someone  bring  me  adderall  or  something
__label__a I’d  gone  thru  the  resin,  ecstasy  speed,  acid  and  all  the  other  ‘recreational  ‘  drugs  I  tore  the  arse  out  of  them  and  booze.  By  the  time  I  was  18/19  I  was  heavily  addicted  to  heroin  and  crack  by  my  20’s  Valium  too.  I’m  45  in  few  months  and  only  back  in  recovery  3  1/2  months.
__label__a Said  before  today's  Christmas  shopping,  I'm  running  on  coke  and  Klonopin.    I  can  do  it!'
__label__c now  i  remember  why  i  stopped  taking  xanax  at  school
__label__a adderall  has  me  studying  for  finals  i  don't  even  have  to  take.
__label__m If  one  more  entitled  Xanax  mom  yells  at  me  to  honor  a  coupon  that  expired  3  years  ago  I’m  jumping  off  a  cliff
__label__c i  didn't  but  it  feels  like  morphine  now  that...well  :)  bye  :)
__label__m _U  _U  Get  this  woman  a  vacation  and  some  xanax.
__label__c What  to  do  when  hydrocodone,promethazine  and  codeine  don't  work!  Lord  what  to  do?  My  chesh  hurfs  and  I  cant  breef!
__label__u lyrica  wants  me  to  reminisce....i  only  got  drug  memories  😂
__label__m ...needs  one  large  mocha  prozac  vodka  latte,  complete  with  whipped  cream  and  valium  sprinkles!  ^^
__label__m _U  My  son  was  going  into  Pharm  4  yrs  ago  but  didn't  when  he  saw  what  the  industry  was  doing  to  people.  Drugs  50X  power  of  morphine!  Killing  US!

__label__c I  have  Trazodone  again.  It'll  help  me  sleep.  Much  like  Seroquel,  It'll  help  my  mind  sleep.  That's  not  a  good  thing.  Goodbye,  insight.
__label__a i  got  morphine  though  so  everything  is  lit  and  i'm  just  tweeting  through  it.  blessssss
__label__m drop  down  and  get  your  need  to  stop  the  aloneness  of  which  i  speak  is  much  more  like    xanax  distributed  -  nayyirah  waheed.
__label__c _U  thanks  to  the  oxycodone  i’ve  been  in  a  pretty  good  dream  mode  at  times  today.  still  not  sure  if  i  am  real  or  not.
__label__c _U  i  got  the  klonopin  😂
__label__c Has  anyone  ever  reduced  their  quetiapine  dose  (slowly,  by  50mg  at  a  time)  who  has  any  advice  on  how  it  all  goes  &  how  to  cope?

THEY  ARE  GOING  TO  TRY  ANOTHER  MEDICATION  TO  SEE  IF  I  CAN  GET  SOME  RELIEF  OR  JUST  TO  MAKE  ME  MORE  COMFORTABLE.  THANK  GOD  FOR  MORPHINE  HUN.  GOD  BLESS
__label__c _U  _U  _U  my  doc  wanted  me  to  take  prozac  forever  i  asked  for  valium  and  only  needed  28  tabs  over  2  years
__label__m i  mean  pop  an  adderall  &  eat  a  salad.  pretend  like  you  care
__label__m _U  stop  buying  xanax  period,  or  you  are  going  to  die.  bad  batch  or  not.
__label__m _U  I  know  it's  recorded,  but  looks  like  Maria  needed  a  Valium  to  calm  down  while  she  was  yelling  w/Paul  Ryan.
__label__m _U  _U  he's  gonna  have  the  morphine  drip  going.
__label__c _U  _U  well  i  use  to  to  sing  to  jac    on  display  on  display  jacko  wacko  today,  please  do  not  take  my  xanax  away  away  😂
__label__m _U  _U  This  survey  fails  to  recognize  that  buprenorphine  is  not  legal  for  pain  care  in  some  states.  I  wonder  what  kind  of  a  response  they  will  see....
__label__m _U  _U  No  human  in  the  planet  needs  anything  stronger  than  morphine.    Ever.      Morphine  is  what  is  given  to  people  in  hospice.  If  you  need  a  drug  that’s  more  potent  &  lasts  a  shorter  time  than  what’s  given  to  hospice  patients,  come  to  grips  recognizing  the  REAL  program  you’re  in.
__label__c morphine  made  my  tummy  sooooooooo  much  better  ..

__label__c _U  Fuck  ssris...  For  real  Everytime  they  put  me  on  em  it  was  so  awful,  they  finally  put  me  on  Klonopin  and  I've  been  great  (anxiety  wise)  ever  since.  Ssris  are  the  devil..
__label__a woahhhh.  that  morphine  hit  quick  af..

__label__u #LHHATL  Love  and  Hip  Hop  Hollywood  is  looking  quiet  interesting.  I  wonder  who  Lyrica  was  accused  of  sleeping  with?  Why  A1  is  on  a  table  and  what  is  up  with  Ray,  princess  and  the  pregnancy  debacle...  hm  🤔
__label__m _U  _U  As  far  as  problems  for  society  and  threats  to  oppressed  people  go,  Roseanne  fucking  Barr  and  her  racist  Xanax  tweets  is  almost  as  far  down  the  list  as  you  can  go.
__label__m dear  f*ckwits  -  people  denied  the  dsp  due  to  your  changes  may  throw  a  positive  for  morphine  because  of  diabling  pain.  #budget2017  #auspol
__label__a _U  hahahahaha  i  honesty  just  give  up.  instead  of  using  adderall  for  my  education  im  usin  it  to  focus  on  making  playlist.  i  quit

__label__m _U  _U  lordy,  it's  a  xanax  in  your  covfefe  kinda  morning.
__label__m _U  The  Left  in  America  are  in  a  tailspin  meltdown  and  lashing  out  in  the  best  way  they  know  how  by  dividing  us  between  gender,  race  and  divisive  political  dogma.    The  Chardonnay  and  Xanax  self-medicating  isn’t  working.
__label__c adderall  has  me  talking  about  life,  how  ignorant  anti  gay  rights  are  &  life  intelligence  vs.  book  intelligence  since  9  p.m  w/_U😂

I  think  if  someone  were  acting  that  way  with  me,  I'd  be  looking  around  seeing  if  security  was  nearby.  Unprofessional  as  can  be.    And  I'm  sure  he  was  crying  like  he  said...lol.

__label__m _U  it's  so  annoying.  everyone's  like  he  mixed  it  w  something  like  no???  i've  seen  ppl  angry  as  fuck  on  xanax  lmao
__label__c _U  GP:  "tramadol  isn't  normally  used  for  chronic  costochondritis,  but..  i  suppose  you  aren't  a  normal  patient"    Me:  "charming"
__label__m _U  i  have  2  words  for  leftists.  ativan  and  haldol.  ok?!

__label__m Somebody  explain  the  appeal  of  Valium  to  me

__label__m @insp_lyons  @bengoldacre  @vicenews  isn't  buprenorphine  much  less  dangerous?  (thru  not  being  brightly  coloured  glucose  syrup,  at  least)
__label__m _U  Only  go  for  the  morphine

__label__u shut  up  lyrica  really  is  the  biggest  deanoru  stan  get  with  the  winning  team
__label__c _U  I'm  also  very  sensitive  to  meds.  Olanzapine  was  not  good  for  me.Terrible  antipsychotic!
__label__m _U  so  she  doesn't  want  Valium...  does  she  speak  some  advanced  language  where  female  is  Valion  and  male  is  Malion?  she  may  be  on  it
__label__m Lil  Xan  taught  me  that  xanax  will  betray  you.  That's  is  all.

__label__a you  don't  know  what  melting  feels  like  until  you're  incredibly  stoned  on  weed  and  hydrocodone  in  100°  weather
__label__m _U  most  doctors  are  like  that  but  i  don’t  see  why  with  abilify  considering  it’s  not  something  like  klonopin
__label__c Ugh.  Morphine.  Why  does  it  say  Mighty  Morphin  #PowerRangers  when  it  makes  you  feel  so  dizzy?  Not  mighty  at  all.
__label__c so  i  guess  all  the  morphine  wore  off.  death  came  back  full.  force.  🙃🙃🙃🙃
__label__c _U  I’d  much  prefer  weed  xanax  any  day,  but  I’m  not  in  a  legal  state  and  haven’t  had  a  connect  for  a  while  😕

__label__m _U  _U  I've  been  experimenting  with  writing  my  replies  and  then  deleting  them  before  posting.  It's  a  methadone  approach.
__label__m _U  Give  your  backend  services  some  valium  so  we  can  play  here.
__label__a _U  _U  first  i  had  bourbon  in  mind...but  i  think  valium  will  do  also..
__label__c When  you're  stressed  out  so  your  pancreas  has  a  rage  quit  and  you  can  literally  feel  it  dying,  but  your  morphine  isn't  kicking  in.      Today  sucks.
__label__m _U  It's  measured  in  "morphine  milligram  equivalent"  per  capita.    So  instead  of  #  of  scripts  or  pills,  it  takes  into  account  the  potency  of  the  pills  as  well.
__label__m _U  _U  oh,  come  on!  that  is  not  a  diazepam  pen.  it's  obviously  a  rechargeable  battery  for  the  android  hillary  double.  duh...
__label__m valium  is  the  best  drug  on  the  market
__label__m _U  xanax  is  the  wrong  hands  leads  to  bad  things  😂

__label__a coffee  and  adderall  are  about  to  become  my  best  friends  this  semester  and  next  year  😅
__label__a i  just  took  a  xanax  and  then  chased  it  down  with  a  monster  and  i'm  starting  to  see  why  that  was  a  bad  decision.
__label__m i  kinda  wish  i  1)  had  some  lorazepam  and  2)  didn’t  tolerate  lorazepam  so  VERY  poorly
__label__c Thank  fucks  for  xanax.  Today  feels  like  it's  been  just  one  long  panic  attack.
__label__c Netflix,  heating  pad,  pizza,  &  hydrocodone.  All  I’m  missing  is  a  back  rub  from  my  main  thing  ☹️
__label__m maybe  you  can  meet  me  in  the  hallway  give  me  morphine  and  take  my  pain  away
__label__a What’s  a  better  relationship  than  taking  adderall  and  tattooing  the  other  all  day  in  a  sunny  field
__label__c you'd  think  after  being  given  morphine  2  hours  ago  &  then  being  given  an  oxycontin  right  before  i  left  the  hospital  i'd  be  a  sleep.  but  nope
__label__a me  (dumbass)  has  taken  5  pills  of  lorazepam  today

__label__c when  the  adderall  finally  kicks  in  🙌👌
__label__m i  need  an  iv  of  caffeine  w/a  hint  of  liquid  morphine
__label__c i  love  insurance  there's  nothing  more  satisfying  than  free  birth  control  and  a  $1  xanax  prescription
__label__m Look  back  at  reviewer  centre  -  did  I  really  review  an  article  on  tamper-resistant  oxycodone  on  my  birthday  this  year?  What  a  party  animal.
__label__a oh  shit  i  found  10mg  of  adderall  vibrates
__label__m _U  _U  _U  that  was  the  xanax  talking
__label__m _U  their  adderall  probably  wore  off  :)
__label__c "how  did  i  not  realize  how  amazing  my  life  is?  how  amazing  the  world  is??"  -me  every  time  i  forget  i  took  adderall  this  morning
__label__m _U  just  to  be  clear:  valium  are  not  depression  meds.
__label__u Lyrica  is  beautiful...  but  these  hair  choices
__label__m _U  Mate  ,  I’m  eating  a  hot  pie  washed  down  with  a  cup  of  coffee,  sweating  like  a  junkie  in  the  methadone  queue
__label__c I  don't  remember  half  the  shit  I  did  when  I  was  taking  Xanax
__label__c and  then  tomorrow  i  take  more  xanax  hahahah
__label__m “if  pills  were  cars,  xanax  would  be  a  honda  and  these  i  got  here  are  fucking  maseratis,  brah!”
__label__a i  sound  like  an  idiot  but  it's  because  i've  had  a  fever  ranging  from  100  to  104  degrees  since  tuesday  night,  and  i  took  too  much  klonopin
__label__a if  it  wasn't  for  adderall  or  vyvanse  during  exams........  😲🔫
__label__c _U  _U  Its  ok.  Yeah.  They  dont  bloody  work  though.  And  its  morphine  😭  x
__label__a i  wish  i  had  xanax  and  you
__label__m _U  Ur  poppin  morphine  like  it's  haribo  let  me  live
__label__a someone  bring  me  a  diet  coke  and  some  xanax
__label__m _U  i  now  put  a  baby  gate  in  front  of  my  door  and  the  dog  has  a  xanax  prescription  for  storms.  it's  very  ridiculous.
__label__a Who  got  hydrocodone?
__label__m Just  like  heroine,  nicotine,  morphine.  Suddenly  I'm  a  fied  and  you're  all  I  need.
__label__c _U  i'm  older,  have  used  every  single  ssri-  and  nsri-meds,  codein  (with  paracetamol),  lyrica  (hell!),  but  opioids  help  a  little.
__label__c i  started  taking  abilify  yesterday.  today  i  organized  and  got  some  cleaning  done.  it  felt  nice  to  finish  something.
__label__c adderall  got  a  nigga  shit  aching
__label__m i  got  no  job  i  got  no  money  got  no  self  esteem    i  take  a  xanax  every  mornin  for  anxiety
__label__m _U  if  it's  dental  pain  morphine  isn't  going  to  do  anything  for  the  pain.
__label__c _U  I  have  a  few  co-morbid  diagnosis  so  I  am  on  what  I  call  a  fruit  cocktail.    Includes  Prozac,  doxepin,  saphris  and  abilify.    Ambien  to  sleep
__label__c curled  up  in  bed  with  a  hot  water  bottle  and  diazepam  -  shutting  the  world  out!
__label__m Just  gonna  say  this  once...  if  you're  on  Suboxone,  you  aren't  clean.  You  can't  replace  one  drug  with  another  and  claim  to  be  off  drugs.  Smh.
__label__a _U  _U  _U  anyone  wanna  grind  cod  aw  msg  adderall  70mg  for  inv.
__label__a _U  _U  _U  This  is  what  happens  when  you  skim-read  Liberal  Fascism  while  high  on  Valium
__label__c Exactly...    It’s  even  hurt  the  mental  health  community  because  a  lot  of  medications  have  become  near  impossible  to  get  if  you  aren’t  wealthy  and  buying  your  doctor...    I  have  bipolar  and  I’ve  had  to  switch  doctors  over  trying  to  take  my  seroquel  which  is  very  common  treatment
__label__m i  leant  abt  valium  today  and  all  i  could  think  abt  was  jimin  snorting  that  shit  in  house  of  cards
__label__a this  is  why  i  don't  write  papers  or  do  homework  without  vyvanse  lol
__label__m _U  3  advil  and  hydrocodone  are  two  completely  different  things.
__label__m sandy  sells  seroquel  down  by  the  seashore
__label__a How  Do  I  Get  Xanax  Delivered  To  Me  At  Work    Please  and  Thank  You
__label__c i  genuinely  wish  i  could  get  seroquel  without  going  through  my  ssri  obsessed  doctor
__label__a I  feel  like  popping  an  Adderall  and  cleaning  up  my  laptop  files  lmao
__label__a _U  Klonopin  and  ativan  mixed  with  vodka!!!
__label__a Ur  wcw  pops  an  adderall  so  she  can  actually  hang  w  out  falling  asleep
__label__u _U  If  you  stopped  watching  after  mighty  morphine  then  you  ain’t  a  fan  and  don  deserve  to  talk  about  power  rangers
__label__a wish  it  was  acceptable  to  load  myself  on  lorazepam  before  bed  #knockmethefuckout
__label__m _U  And  people  werent  overdosing  on  norco  unless  they  paired  it  up  with  muscle  relaxers  and  xanax  and  over  did  it  by  a  mile
__label__m _U  xanax  will  literally  do  exactly  that  for  you,  try  it  out  i  guess
__label__m Going  to  Dunkin  at  methadone  hour  is  a  fucking  nightmare.
__label__c i  think  i  need  to  up  my  vyvanse  dosage  next  time  i  go  to  the  doctor!
__label__a your  mcm  pops  lyrica  that  he  stole  from  his  mom
__label__a the  best  feeling  is  when  you  aren't  on  adderall  but  still  want  to  do  all  your  homework
__label__m you  call  people  out  for  doing  xanax  but  you  made  a  whole  song  about  you  doing  it  ??????!!!!!!!!😷😷  fufu
__label__m Sometimes  I  feel  like  a  living  xanax
__label__m TRUMP  means    Though  Replotted  Unconventionally  Morphine  Pecked
__label__m everybody  on  my  xanax  tweets
__label__m maybe  martinez  has  had  all  our  squad  doing,  but  due  to  a  mix  up  we've  ended  up  with  a  load  of  'scripts  for  valium
__label__a listen  i'm  not  even  gonna  front.  i  rail  like  3mg  of  xans  before  every  tweet  i  compose.  u  can  thank  alprazolam  for  my  vulgarity
__label__m Out  here  poppin  melatonin  like  it’s  Xanax  bars  to  you  thots
__label__m if  i  could  even  get  half  the  valium  of  what  my  patients  in  these  problems  were  getting  i  would  be  a  much  nicer  nursing  student
__label__m _U  _U  Just  refill  your  Xanax  sweetie.  Gonna  be  a  tough  road  ahead
__label__a 2v2  prime  today  _U  hmu  i  will  be  on  60mg  of  adderall  lmk!
__label__c throwback  to  2015,  when  i  started  every  morning  with  coffee  and  clonazepam  for  my  depression  and  anxiety  (respectively)
__label__c 0.5mg  ativan  to  the  rescue!  :)
__label__a xanax  bars,  percocets,  &  loritabs.  all  these  damn  drugs  make  me  feel  like  i  can  fly
__label__u #LHHH  I'm  feeling  that  hair  Lyrica!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Stop  using  OxyContin  funds  from  Purdue  family  to  financially  sustain  your  organization.  Then  you  won’t  be  viewed  as  hypocritical.  #stopfundingSAM
__label__a how  much  diazepam  do  i  have  to  take  in  order  to  tell  girls  how  hot  they  are!!!  girls  are  terrifying
__label__m I  was  injected  with  morphine,  in  my  dream.  Then  i  woke  up.  🤷🏻‍♀️😂  good  morning!
__label__c 100mg  of  vyvanse  got  me  feeling  like  taking  down  all  of  isis  and  donald  trump  supporters.
__label__m Some  guy  just  asked  me  if  I  knew  where  he  could  adderall..  yeah  from  ur  doctor??
__label__m It  only  takes  the  tiniest  bit  to  be  lethal  and  is  hard  to  locate  for  non-scientific  minded  dealers.  They're  still  selling  the  old  version  of  oxycontin  where  you  chewed  it  to  bypass  the  time-release  -  Purdue  stopped  making  them.  But  they're  everywhere  still,  most  with  fentanyl.
__label__m _U  _U  we  are  talking  about  the  difference  between  Adderall  and  Steroids  ...  lets  not  get  crazy  with  this
__label__m I  feel  sorry  for  the  doctors  who  work  in  methadone  clinic.  Everyday  kena  attack  by  the  patients.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Owning  a  gun  implies  a  threat?  Wtf  dosage  of  Xanax  are  YOU  on?
__label__c hoping  those  xanax  hit  right  where  ya  pain  is  ,  oh  ohh
__label__c quetiapine  just  isn't  cutting  it  anymore
__label__c also  dropped  off  my  adderall  script  at  the  pharmacy  but  they're  currently  out  of  stock  :(
__label__m Enter  cherry  lithium  gummies,  or  grape  effexor  gummies,  or  sour  apple  risperdal  and  lemon  drop  wellbutrin!  Better  absorption,  yes?
__label__m God,  for  some  of  you  it's  a  problem  if  Adele  hangs  out  with  celebrities  friends,  if  she  disappears,  if  she  doesn't  rest,  if  she  rests,  it's  a  problem  if  she  doesn't  spend  time  with  her  son  or  if  she  spends  too  much  time  with  him,  some  of  you  need  a  xanax,  you're  so  annoying
__label__m love  how  the  intensive  care  nurses  say  bens  the  politest  boy  ever,  he's  high  on  morphine  but  still  remembers  please  and  thank  you  #strong
__label__m Ah.  High  affinity,  so  gets  to  receptor  first,  before  the  naloxone?  I  wonder  why  naloxone  is  even  included  in  Suboxone  then.  Could  probably  talk  about  this  all  night  lol,  but  going  tear  myself  away  to  sleep.  Looking  forward  to  engaging  in  the  future.  Again  thank  you  for  the  info!!
__label__c i  have  more  dental  work  today  you  guys  so  prepare  yourselves  for  the  drunk  tweets.  also.  she  prescribed  me  valium  this  time!
__label__c _U  i  was  on  seroquel  for  years
__label__c For  sure!  I  had  gone  to  the  clinic  for  a  fever  and  they  couldn't  find  the  source  at  all  (spiritual);  they  prescribed  me  to  take  1  mg  of  Lorazepam  a  day  cause  they  thought  I  was  stressed.  That's  why  I  feel  so  strong  about  these  things.  I've  experienced  the  deception,    in  a  way.
__label__c I  also  burn  all  over.    Like  dipped  in  acid.    Neurontin  helps  slightly,  but  I  lost  a  great  PMD.    New  guy  cut  everything  bc  our  Gov  went  on  a  opioid  rave.    Muscle  relaxers,  Neurontin  (for  burning)  cut  2  ea.    About  7-8  hrs  extra  pain.    Government:  driving  excellent  legit  docs  away  .
__label__c _U  i  took  an  oxycodone  as  soon  as  i  woke  up  this  morning
__label__a adderall  had  me  doing  literally  everything  except  studying
__label__c a  couple  of  things:  1)  my  strep  throat  is  so  bad  that  i  was  prescribed  hydrocodone    alongside  antibiotics
__label__m To  Jackie  Dupre,  Live  in  a  Group  Home,  an  Adult  Foster  Care!  Stay  on  Abilify!
__label__m Per  Guardian:  Rudy  Giuliani  won  deal  4  OxyContin  maker  2  continue  sales  of  drug  behind  opioid  deaths.  US  gov't  secured  a  criminal  conviction  against  Purdue  Pharma  in  the  mid-2000s  but  failed  to  curb  sales  of  drug  after  Giuliani  reached  deal  2  avoid  a  bar  on  Purdue  doing  business.
__label__c _U  the  good  news  is  since  i  took  the  ativan  so  late  i  feel  really  mellow  even  though  i  am  balls  tired
__label__c accidentally  took  my  adderall  when  i  got  home  from  school.  #habits  #toofocused
__label__m slowly  learning  what  boys  to  stay  away  from:  band  boys,  xanax  boys,  white  boys  who  wanna  be  black,  lightskins  w  nose  rings
__label__c i'll  never  forgive  xanax  for  breaking  my  first  bong
__label__m _U  naproxen,  gabapentin,  a  pint  of  squash  &  #thearchers.    the  tweetalong  tends  to  be  a  great  distraction  from  pain.
__label__c two  life  concerns:  -my  adderall  isn't  working    -i  should  feel  stressed  about  all  my  work  but  don't.
__label__c _U    _U  _U  I  have  suffered  chronic  back  pain  since  2000  when  I  was  badly  assaulted  when  I  was  a  police  officer  saving  a  life  (now  Ned  retired)  Can’t  understand  how  medicinal  cannabis  be  worse  than  the  Morphine  I  take  daily?  Keep  the  campaign  going.
__label__m Both  gmc  and  cqc  made  hetoic  efforts  in  their  -  futile  -attempts  to  exculpate  consultant  of  any  wrong-doing.  According  to  them  its  no  big  deal  to  give  morphine  to  morphine-intolerant  patient,  thereby  causing  their  death.  Silly  me!  To  make  a  fuss!
__label__m Have  suicidal  thoughts?You  probably  have  Bipolar.This  causes  loneliness.Try  Methadone
__label__m everyone  want  xanax  but  they  don't  even  know  what  it  does  to  you
__label__m _U  hey  they  saw  an  ad  for  lyrica  once,  they  can  tell  me  all  about  fibro  now,  they  even  read  the  fine  print!
__label__c So  some  of  you  know  my  woes  w/the  nerve  pain  medicine,  Gabapentin.  It  does  a  number  on  me,  makes  me  real  foggy.  With  Lupus  &  fibro  already  having  that  side  effect,  I  don’t  need  that.
__label__m shouldve  named  my  dog  xanax    bc  i  ❤️  palindromes  u  guys
__label__c _U  i'm  on  1800mg  of  gabapentin  daily  and  duloxetine  too  ..  hate  it  !!
__label__c _U  don't  know  exactly..  adderall  makes  me  clean  and  be  organized
__label__m you're  like  xanax  to  me  🙏
__label__m _U  Why  does  it  matter  if  you’re  popping  a  couple  Ativan  and  immediately  sleeping  through  the  flight  either  way?
__label__c hopefully  my  adderall  wakes  me  up  for  today,  if  not  i'm  done  for  lol
__label__c i  don't  even  take  xanax  unless  im  having  a  panic  attack.  how  tf  do  people  remember  their  days  on  multiple  bars?  idk  but  be  safe  please
__label__m _U  lmfao  you  are  1  weird  ass  kd  vyvanse  at  a  house  party  lol
__label__m SELL  u  vyvanse  powder  n  call  it  coke
__label__c _U  _U  surgery  but  to  be  honest  so  full  of  morphine  was  hardly  aware.
__label__m _U  cost  more  than  xanax
__label__c 3  tests  tomorrow  with  no  adderall  prescription  left,  i've  already  took  the  l
__label__m _U  _U  My  late  Father  lived  to  82.  He  was  on  Oxycodone  for  last  12  years  of  his  life.  No  issues  whatsoever.
__label__m Oh  good.  Travis  Bickle  is  here  at  the  Ft  Lauderdale  airport  to  work  security.  😬  Dude,  this  is  Florida,  take  a  valium  and  relax
__label__m adderall  should  be  prescribed  to  everyone
__label__m _U    thanks  for  the  rec.  are  you  watching  bloodline  on  netflix?  it's  insane  good.  you  need  a  xanax    after  every  episode.
__label__m I  hope  quetiapine  makes  not  lose  people  anymore...
__label__m So,  NYC  will  offer  methadone  maintenance  AND  injection  supervision?  That  is  amazingly  compassionate  and  surely  intended  well.  But:    1.  Who  is  supervising  the  drug  users?    2.  Tax  payers  footing  the  bill?    3.  NGO's  helping  will  have  their  liability  insurance  covered  by  city?
__label__m @callmedaniiii  ahaha  they  got  adderall  mixed  up  with  xanax
__label__a maybe  being  an  economics  major  was  too  ambitious  and  i  should  settle  for  a  life  collecting  vintage  posters  and  abusing  xanax
__label__c Normal  lorazepam  isn't  cutting  it
__label__c _U  Klonopin  makes  me  feel  pretty  normal.  If  I  take  too  much  I  do  stupid  shit  tho  haha
__label__m adderall  is  great  if  you  really  need  to  repaint  the  walls  of  your  house  at  4am  for  no  reason.
__label__m _U  sending  u  mental  Ativan  💕🌿
__label__c i  only  want  xanax  because  i  have  severe  anxiety  but  i  don't  have  a  prescription  for  it  so  i'm  not  gonna  fw  it
__label__m _U  lay  off  the  xanax  son
__label__c One  of  the  few  times  I'm  regretting  not  accepting  the  adderall  bc  I  literally  fked  myself  today  bc  of  my  ADHD
__label__m Never  be  the  same!  Just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine
__label__m this  adderall/oxycontin  commercial  just  annoyed  me
__label__c _U  I've  tried  many  things  the  last  35  years  to  relieve    migraines.  Only  oxycodone  helps.  Last  resort  for  Docs  not  1st.
__label__m “Nurseeee.  Nurssssseee.  I  need  bacon  and  a  cigarette.”  Yes,  and  I  need  Ativan  but  that’s  not  going  to  happen  🙄
__label__m the  first  people  to  have  oxycontin  tested  on  them  were  puerto  rican  women.  wow.  |  via  _U
__label__c I  just  took  my  first  seroquel  in  days  and  also  am  having  my  first  night  in  alone  in  my  apartment  in  a  while  and  also  I  don’t  have  to  work  tomorrow  and  things  are  pretty  damn  good.
__label__m _U  In  the  meantime  rural  America  is  flooded  with  OxyContin  and  most  of  the  users  there  are  white  Americans.
__label__c With  such  a  melodic  name,  there  is  something  cruel  about  a  drug  named  Lyrica  making  you  want  to  kill  yourself.
__label__c they  should’ve  told  you  i  was  on  a  pill,  they  should’ve  told  you  i  was  on  a  lyrica
__label__m i'm  almost  ready  guys  finally  i  need  adderall
__label__a bothered  by  the  fact  i  sleep  a  lot?  then  buy  me  adderall  or  what  the  fuck  &  we  can  fuck  and  cuddle  and  talk  all  night  or  what  is  it  u  want
__label__a good  weed  i  smoke  that  xanax  i  hid  that  right  by  my  nut  sack
__label__a _U  Now,  I  wish  to  know  if  I  can  go  back  taking  the  two  expired  drugs  to  "get  me  out  of  this  situation".    Would  water  tapering  work  for  the  Midazolam  and  Zyprexa?    Thank  you  very  much  for  getting  back  to  me  on  this.
__label__m Half  of  you  guys  wouldn’t  even  know  what  Xanax  was  if  it  wasn’t  for  these  rappers  who  promote  it  stop  taking  that  shit  you  dumb  fucks
__label__c _U  Cheers.  I  guess  I'll  see  what  happens,  and  hope  it  doesn't  involve  knocking  me  on  my  arse  with  Seroquel.
__label__u even  Lyrica  from  LHHH  album  pretty  good  lol  everybody  winnin.
__label__c _U  every  time  they  give  me  more  morphine  through  it  they  have  to  flush  it  with  sodium  whatever  and  i  can  taste  it  in  my  mouth!!
__label__m _U  I  highly  recommend  getting  something  from  the  vet.    With  Chuck's  heart  condition  I  got  Gabapentin  to  ease  the  stress.    Now  they  are  just  sleeping.
__label__m _U  _U  spike  the  elderly  with  (extra)  valium  and  sit  them  in  front  of  an  omnibus  of  gardeners'  world  on  repeat
__label__a bitch  im  done  bein  on  xanax  gonna  pook  yp  hexes  for  _U
__label__c If  you've  ever  been  on  morphine  that  will  instantly  make  sense  to  you
__label__a I  got  liquid  hydrocodone  because  I  can’t  stop  coughing  at  night  and  am  getting  zero  sleep.  Well,  now  I’m  higher  than  a  kite.  Than  a  plane.  Than  ANYTHING.
__label__m _U  My  RSO  is  made  specifically  for  me.  I'm  liking  it,  lots,  as  I  formerly  was  prescribed  300  mgs/daily  morphine,  and  it  was  awful.  Life  is  much  more  Interesting,  now.  🙂
__label__c _U      i  cheat  (don't  tell  my  gi  doc  lol)  and  take  ibu.  it's  the  only  thing  that  helps.  ibu  800mg  every  6-8  hrs  &  5  mg  diazepam  &🙏🏻
__label__m don't  bring  me  no  xanax
__label__m how  long  does  oxycodone  take  affect?
__label__m Somebody  go  give  that  cry  baby  ass  nigga  a  Valium  or  a  trip  to  the  fckn  nut  house...
__label__m _U  How  many  Valium  cocktails  does  she  drink?
__label__m a  person  just  demanded  valium  from  me  so  hard  he  spelled  it  out  for  me.  hahahaha  i'm  crying.

__label__c _U  Part  of  fibromyalgia  is  sensory  overload.  My  Lyrica  doesn't  help  my  pain  directly,  but  it  does  indirectly  through  softening  the  sensory  overload.  It  allows  me  to  walk  into  a  grocery  store  and  not  get  so  dizzy  I  almost  fall  down.  So,  in  that  regard  it  works.
__label__m _U  I  will  just  live  in  a  tent  or  drink  the  morphine  and  jump  in  the  canal

__label__c I've  had  an  anxiety  attack  in  several  instances  in  front  of  her,  discord  and  RL.  She's  brought  me  back  effectively  every  time.  About  a  million  times  better  than  lorazepam  FR.  I  wouldn't  normally  interject  but  I  feel  indebted  to  her  for  this  reason.  Reals  before  feels.  &lt;3

__label__m _U  come  back  with  nicotine  heroin  morphine  plss
__label__m when  a  patient  visits  md  4  morphine  refills,  he  shouldn't  b  told  "it's  easier  2  write  a  prescripx  for  two  60mg  than  two  30mg,  as  needed"
__label__m All  I  need  is  nicotine,  eroine,  cocaine,  morphine.

__label__m I  swear  London  is  just  a  giant  methadone  clinic
__label__c _U  Na,  just  chat  pure  shit  and  on  diazepam  rn
__label__m _U  albert,  suppose  he  took  adderall  as  a  masking  agent.  then  saying  he  tested  positive  for  it  is  not  a  lie.  it's  a  half  truth.
__label__m _U  _U  same,  but  with  klonopin.
__label__m _U  Huh?  Valium  is  a  sedative  dear.
__label__m adderall  solves  about  85%  of  your  problems  in  college,  the  other  15%  can  be  solved  with  alcohol
__label__c _U  It  is!!  I  don’t  think  I  need  my  seroquil  anymore  (because  I  am  happy  yay)  and  the  other  one  is  birth  control  but  (t  m  i)  being  queer  I  don’t  need  it  like  50%  of  the  time  and  it’s  sooo  expensive

__label__m _U  I  find  it  hard  to  believe  she  isn't  snorting  oxycontin
__label__m _U  it  takes  over  100  grams  of  alprazolam  to  od  so  he  was  most  likely  drinking  too  and  mixing  those  two  is  toxic  #riptho
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  OxyContin  now  re  formulated  so  can't  snort  or  chew.  Inscos  prefer  cheaper  meds.
__label__c Now  that  I'm  finally  cutting  down  on  my  morphine  and  oxycodone,  life  would  be  much  easier  if  I  could  take  an  ibuprofen.  But  nope...  when  I  was  bed-ridden  at  the  rehab  place,  I  had  a  small  clot  in  my  leg  and  therefore  had  to  do  3  months  of  Warfarin  which  means  no  ibuprofen.

Nobody  willing  to  provide  in  her  home.  She  was  in  agony.    Morphine  didn't  help  and  the  system  forced  it  upon  her.  I  had  to  fight  to  even  get  her  access.

And  like  you  mentioned  it  plays  havoc  on  the  brain  synapses.  It’s  used  mostly  on  diabetic  and  alcoholics.  The  withdrawals  from  it  are  the  worst.

__label__m soda..xanax..soda...xanax.
__label__m _U  Yes,  reports  of  ADRs  2*  tramadol  are  not  infrequent.  Greater  research  and  tighter  restriction  of  use  needed.

__label__c I'm  honestly  more  afraid  of  dying  because  my  scrips  get  cut  off  in  situations  like  the  CA  proposal  than  I  am  of  the  knowledge  that  my  conditions  will  aggressive  shorten  my  life.      I  had  to  go  3  days  without  my  daily  tramadol  this  weekend  because  of  prescriber  fear.

I  want  to  do  stuff,  but  I  also  want  to  sit  here  and  stare  at  the  wall.    I've  barely  slept  in  a  week.  I  should  probably  just  take  a  Klonopin.  Even  if  it  doesn't  knock  me  out,  it'll  slow  it  down.
__label__c _U  dr  math  and  archangel  xanax  will  be  with  me  but  i  might  steal  away  to  vent  here.

Which  is  good.  There's  XANAX  good  👍🏽&  then  there's  screaming  &  punching  things.  I  know  which  one  is  right  for  me!

__label__m _U  _U  i  bet  when  mitt  suspended  looking  for  a  3rd  you  downed  a  bottle  of  xanax  !!!  lmao
__label__m _U  _U  My  mom’s  pain  clinic  is  no  longer  licensed  to  carry  morphine.      I  have  no  idea  what’s  gonna  happen  in  30  days.

__label__m So  last  night  we  took  my  sister  to  the  hospital  because  she  was  hurting  really  bad  in  her  side.  We  found  out  that  she  had  really  bad  appendicitis  and  she  went  for  surgery  that  same  night.  Now  she's  asleep  with  the  occasional  waking  up  and  rambling  about  random  things  on  morphine.
__label__a adderall  is  good  for  the  study  soul.
__label__m you  didn't  have  to  be  there  to  pay  your  respects.  the  best  way  to  pay  your  respects  to  him  &  connor  is  to  stay  away  from  xanax  &  pills
__label__c _U  Hydrocodone,  but  tbh  it  just  put  me  to  sleep.  Still  felt  pain  haha
__label__m where's  the  fucking  champagne  and  valium

__label__m @setmefreebabe  if  i'm  very  stressed  he  told  me  take  it  please.  if  i'm  already  calm  then  just  do  half  the  neurontin  and  skip  the  xanax...
__label__m so  many  people  addicted  to  xanxax  and  adderall  and  benzo  and  its  taken  so  lightly  because  its  never  seen  as  a  real  issue
__label__m _U  Only  on  a  tech  level  because  he  stayed  on  the  script  that  was  written  for  him  that  really  said  nothing.  A  little  Xanax.
__label__m _U  _U  If  he  wants  to  go  after  “pushers”,  he  should  set  his  sights  on  big  pharma  companies  such  as  Perdue,  the  maker  and  marketer  of  OxyContin.    Or  the  docs  they  pay  to  prescribe  for  them.

__label__a #TheKeyTo  oblivion  is  lots  of  alcohol  and  Xanax,  apparently.

__label__c Me:  ok  I’m  anxious  so  I’ll  bring  xanax  to  work  Me:  drives  to  work
__label__c _U  I  started  taking  it  for  a  few  months,It  made  me  incredibly  sleepy  and  weight  gain  is  a  big  side  effect.  I  switched  too  aripipozole  (abilify)  which  works  better  for  me...But  everyone  reacts  differently.

__label__m Been  watching  a  lot  of  cute  animal  videos  recently.  One  question  -  are    all  Japanese  pets  taking  Diazepam,  or  just  the  ones  on  social  media?
__label__c i  was  started  in  gabapentin  on  monday  for  nerve  pain.  it's  making  me  feel  dreadful  though.  tired  all  the  time  &  dizzy  spells.  urgh  😥
__label__a Self-medicate  with  Valium  &  online  shopping  .  All  I’m  missing  is  my  drink  😭
__label__c _U  I’m  hanging  for  the  day  MM  comes  in.  I  have  stage  2  spondylolithesis.  Chronic  pain,  which  impacts  my  sciatic  nerve  and  effects  the  integrity  of  my  ability  to  stand  for  very  long.  Using  MM  would  allow  me  to  use  my  brain  instead  of  being  woozy  on  codeine  &  morphine.
__label__m multiple  brawls  in  downtown  Denver.    Raiders  fans  need  some  Xanax  or  something?!  isn’t  weed  legal  here?!  calm  down!
__label__m _U  i've  not  heard  of  neurontin,  but  seroquel  has  sold  on  the  street.  pt  use  maybe  due  to  pt's  mental  illness.  _U
__label__m question!  why  do  you  hoodmice  drink  hydrocodone  out  of  baby  bottles?
__label__c Adderall  had  me  explaining  myself  to  snapchat  😂
__label__c Morphine  don't  work  anymore  so  it's  ethanol  to  sleep
__label__m Morphine  addicted!You  must  know  Pappu  knows  better  than  you  but  he  does  not  want  to  offend  the  sentiments  of  the  poor  Coca  Cola  Shikanjiwala.Have  not  you  heard  about  brown  sugar.Whether  it  is  brown  or  white  it  makes  little  difference  for  our  Pappu  master  who  knows  everything.
__label__c that  adderall  crash  was  absolutely  horrible.  i'm  still  having  mood  swings  from  it,  just  not  as  bad  and  i  finally  have  an  appetite  again.
__label__a i  wish  vyvanse  had  an  off  switch  for  when  ur  done  studying
__label__u A1  and  Lyrica  were  supposed  to  make  it  😭
__label__m tripp  guesses  kayla's  password  on  one  try,  alters  the  amount  of  morphine  given,  kayla  walks  in  right  after.  jade  with  eric,  ugh.  #days
__label__m I  take  one  bar  and  now  I'm  basically  a  xanax
__label__c xanax  makes  me  black  out  so  hard......  so  hard.    smh.
__label__m The  doctor  has  him  on  Morphine  and  some  other  strong  meds  to  help  him  with  the  pain.  He  has  a  doctors  appointment  tomorrow  to  see  what  else  they  can  do  for  him.  Poor  thing  can't  even  walk  on  his  own,  not  without  a  cane  and  someone  helping  him.
__label__m i  knew  stevo  would  be  the  one  to  take  md  instead  of  adderall
__label__m What  is  with  all  these  tweets  about  this  new  pill  that's  better  than  Adderall?  I  don't  take  pills.
__label__m a  guy  just  asked  me  to  come  over  and  do  adderall  and  i'm  like?  you  don't  just  "do  adderall"  like??that's  not  an  independent  activity?
__label__m _U  shove  off  buster.  show  risperdal
__label__c Psychiatrist  put  me  on  gabapentin,  often  confused  with  gabapectin,  which  is  not  a  drug  but  an  unusually  loquacious  fruit.
__label__c _U  wish  i  still  had  that  adderall  self  confidence
__label__m Told  that  bitch  get  out  my  ear  She  needs  to  chill  and  (hit  the  blunt)  Xanax  bars  up  in  my  drink  before  I  pour  ‘em  (crush  it  up)💤🎶
__label__m _U  _U  stop  giving  them  prescription  for  methadone  it  us  madness
__label__a my  fault  for  not  snorting  my  pregame  xanax
__label__m man  yam  20  bars  a  day  but  would  slump  of  a  0.5mg  of  alprazolam  🤔  i'm  not  good  at  maths  but...  is  there  such  a  thing  as  selective  believing  ❓
__label__c _U  yeah  i  have  oxycodone  but  they  dont  even  work  lol  so  i  dont  bother  w  them,  i  saw  ur  dad  last  week  we  went  to  breakfast😁

__label__a how  is  this  man  still  thrashing  about  after  40  of  geodon  50  of  benadryl  and  30  of  ativan?

__label__m I  don't  WANT  people  on  #suboxone.  But-  I  REALLY  dont  want  people  on  #heroin.  Heroin  is  a  death  sentence.  Medically  assisted  path    is  a  MAP  to  #life  for  many...  #WhateverItTakes
__label__m watchin  documentary  on  medicating  children  n  they  talk  about  giving  these  kids  xanax  and  anti-psychotics!  #canyouguesstheraceoftheparents
__label__c xanax  got  me  sleepy  rn.
__label__m #comeyday  comey  looks  like  the  valium  just  kicked  in  nods  at  everything  sen  warner  says  &  mouths  the  lyrics  to  #stairwaytoheaven  to  himself
__label__m _U  Bullshit.  Diazepam  is  Valium.  5  mg  yellow  pill  known  as  mellow  yellow.
__label__m ppl  shunning  others  for  doing  coke  meanwhile  popping  xanax  and  percs  like...  really
__label__m _U  Well  that  should  really  put  a  kink  in  Purdue  Pharma's  OxyContin  business  based  in  N.C.  Well  done.  Stellar  job  Feds.
__label__c 4hours  since  i  took  this  valium  and  nothing  has  changed!  😡😡
__label__c adderall  makes  me  really  wanna  mansplain  for  some  reason.
__label__m _U  _U  maybe  its  like  a  methadone  clinic  but  for  roofies
__label__c _U  your  policy  against  medical  cannabis  is  hurting  people  like  me  who  are  trying  to  get  off  tramadol  or  other  opioids.  what  help???

__label__m _U  Annon  needs  Ativan  in  the  worst  way.  That’s  what  you  get  when  you  send  a  hamster  to  interview  a  rattlesnake
__label__m Profit  Over  Trust,  Or  Ethics,  Or...  For  over  20  Yrs,  Purdue  Pharma  aggressively  marketed  Oxycontin  &  fueled  America's  opioid  epidemic.  The  company  has  always  denied  knowing  the  painkiller  was  highly  addictive.  The  US  Justice  Department  just  discovered  it  knew  in  1996.  #Management
__label__c lucas  just  checked  on  me.  i'll  be  okay  just  manic.  bipolar.  i'm  on  the  abilify  shot  but  it  doesn't  seem  to  be  getting  rid  of  nervous  energy.

__label__c _U  _U  The  thank  you  Father  makes  me  choke  on  my  Xanax  everytime  preventing  me  from  leaving  this  living  hellhole
__label__m _U  is  there  any  way  you  can  get  a  prescription  for  morphine  infusions?  i  heard  they  give  resistance  to  agony.
__label__m BEST  FUCKING  FRIEND  SAID  "BISH  ITS  MORPHINE  TIME!!"  lmaoooooo  youbmessing  with  the  wrong  blue  ranger  hahahaha
__label__a _U  _U  _U  _U  I  want  a  morphine  overdose,  enough  to  permanently  put  me  to  sleep
__label__m #PrepareForHolidaysIn4Words  Honey,  where's  the  xanax?
__label__c i  need  to  get  another  seroquel  prescription
__label__m dont  think  i'm  leaving  my  room  tomorrow.  wish  i  had  xanax
__label__c Usually  tramadol  knock  me  out  but  not  this  time  😭  every  hour  I’ve  woke  up  in  agony
__label__m why  is  methadone  free  for  drug  addicts  but  chemo  isn't  free  for  cancer  patients  🤔
__label__m You  know  your  pet  knows  shit’s  going  down  when  it  barfs  at  the  sight  of  veterinarian’s  DOOR.    For  once,  the  stupid  fuck  recognised  me  as  his  protector  when  the  catheter  was  gone.    *climbs  your  shirt*  &gt;YOU!  TAKE  ME  AS  FAR  AWAY  AS  YOU  CAN  FROM  HERE  O///O    No  diazepam  today
__label__m _U  _U  Now  he's  conspiracy  theorizing  about  Kanye  West.    Dude.  You  need  Abilify.  Haldol.  Something.

__label__m _U  Time  they  quit  the  wine  and  Xanax  habbit.
__label__m He's  gonna  be  like  Ian  Malcolm  on  Space  Morphine.
__label__m We  also  have  an  entirely  new  generation  of  non  mμ  OUD  users  who  inject  Buprenorphine  strips  w  or  wo  Naloxone  3x  day+.  I've  heard  through  employees  at  a  Sub  Clinic  that  this  stuff  is  selling  for  $15-$25  a  dose  on  the  streets  😕
__label__a i’m  craving  tramadol  so  much  i  hate  this
__label__m _U  Or  a  shrink  who  could  give  her  a  few  bottles  of  valium?    #TCMParty  #CatPeople
__label__m My  mixes  are  dedicated  to  college  students  without  adderall
__label__m dominate  epilepsy  in  the  midst  of  pregabalin  practice:  .wpa
__label__m xanax  is  needed  for  this  game!!!  #worldseries
__label__a dozing  off  them  xanax  just  popped  a  bandit  laflare
__label__m they  could  bottle  nick  compton  up  and  use  him  as  valium  😴😴
__label__a _U  _U  Did  he  have  dental  surgery  recently?    That’s  oxycodone  buzz  -  happy  and  high  as  a  kite
__label__m yo  i  was  jusy  lookin  at  the  drug  schedules  an  what  drugs  are  in  em  an  xanax  is  a  schedule  4  but  adderall  is  a  schedule  2.  don  make  sense
__label__a _U  _U  I’ll  get  her  to  sneak  some  morphine  out  haha
__label__c i've  researched  9  pills  tramadol  can  caused  stop  breathing  completely.  oh  wow  but  tramadol  was  my  pain  killer  😅
__label__m If  its  legal  to  drive  after  receiving  official  Methadone  treatment  -  then  is  the  government  legally  liable  for  any  harm  the  drug  addict  causes  after  their  offical  Meth  treatment  ?
__label__m just  like  NICOTINE  HEROIN  MORPHINE  sudddenly  i’m  a  fiend  and  you’re    ALL  I  NEED    yeah  you’re    ALL  I  NEED
__label__m _U  How  come  the  one  who  writes  the  prescription  is  never  to  blame?  Pain  control  is  very  complicated,  but  oxycontin  is  a  controlled  substance  and  the  only  way  to  get  it  is  a  prescription.  Ask  the  medical  professionals  if  they  are  complicit  .
__label__m there's  a  sorority  girl  who's  in  2  of  my  classes  who  is  randomly  chummy  w/  me.  last  week  she  told  me  she  took  adderall  to  keep  up  w/  school.
__label__c also  thank  god  for  vyvanse  💕

__label__c If  I  don't  get  some  goddamn  xanax  in  the  next  hour  I'm  gonna  fucking  kick  off
__label__m _U  Crows  playing  like  they  are  on  valium.
__label__a _U  can  someone  override  these  people  and  call  me  in  a  Valium  prescription  at  WalGreens.    This  absurd  to  leave  me  like  this
__label__c ativan  or  warm  milk

__label__m thank  god  i  did  that  thing  i  did  while  i  was  super  fucked  up  on  xanax  it's  made  my  life  so  much  better  -  no  one  ever
__label__c _U  tramadol  is  the  shit  though.  you  become  one  with  the  mattress.
__label__c _U  yeah,  i  have  been  told  trying  lyrica  would  upset  my  meds  too.  ahh,  mental  health  or  pain.  not  a  great  choice  to  make.  ❤️
__label__a oxycodone  is  my  first  love
__label__c i'm  so  ready  to  have  adderall  back  in  my  life.
__label__m _U  _U  Have  you  anything  positive  to  say?  Get  back  on  your  neurontin  pls  and  oh  yea,  RETIRE
__label__c _U  nah  adderall  does  the  trick
__label__c _U  I’ve  been  withdrawing  from  12  years  of  doctor-prescribed  morphine,  over  400mgs  daily.    Now  I  am  in  excruciating  pain  but  aren’t  I  “good”?  Surely  the  moral  judgments  matter  more  than  the  medical.
__label__u _U  _U  is  this  somg  lyrica  im  honna  vommie

__label__m _U        thanks  to  #afghanistan  heroin  now  reportedly  much  less  expensive  in  usa  than  oxycontin®  and  oxymorphone
__label__m Mental  health  is  a  spirit  and  if  a  mental  health  person  can  function  normal  most  of  the  time  he  or  she  knows  morphine,  codeine  (1/2)
__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine.  Suddenly.  Im  a  fiend  and  ur  all  I  need.
__label__c I  am  finally  home  and  resting  so  the  morphine  tweets  have  come  to  an  end.  I  get  to  spend  my  weekend  trying  to  pass  a  2mm  kidney  stone  so  that’s  cool  🙃

__label__u _U  Just  started  twitter  a  few  days  ago,  &  I'm  glad  to  have  found  you  here.  You;re  one  of  my  all  time  favorites.

__label__m ._U  its  aight  jus  send  me  some  xanax
__label__m _U  The  NHS  is  a  raging  fire  that  burns  taxpayers  money.    3/4  of  a  million  quid  to  keep  a  single  junkie  on  their  daily  dose  of  methadone?    No  wonder  it  has  problems.
__label__m _U  there,  there.  take  a  valium  and  lie  down.  #gop

__label__m A  Philadelphia  hospital  did  this  2  my  father  w/morphine.  I  didn't  know  what  was  going  on.  He'd  flatline  +  I'd  scream  4  the  nurses  who  wld  roll  their  eyes  +  revive  him  somehow.  Only  later  I  realized  they  killed  him.  And  I  didn't  stop  it  because  I  was  clueless.  My  lifetime  burden.

__label__c _U  I’m  pretty  curious  why  a  morphine/percocet  combo  is  allowed  (still  have  my  morphine  prescription),  but  a  harmless  herb  isn’t.  Can  I  still  drink  thyme  tea  for  pain?  Would  it  be  best  to  get  some  kratom?  What  kind  of  “epidemic”  are  we  having  again?
__label__c i  just  really  need  a  valium  and  a  cigarette
__label__c _U  _U  My  pain  was  so  great  from  a  ruptured  disc  that  by  the  time  they  gave  me  morphine,  it  might  as  well  have  been  a  Tylenol.    Emergency  surgery  saved  me.

__label__m _U  Sure.  I'd  prefer  a  valium  suppository  though.
__label__c _U  me  too!  lyrica  works  for  my  nerve  pain,  but  it's  not  cheap.  it  works  so  much  better  than  the  generic  for  neurontin  though.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Drug  addicts  will  do  anything  for  $20.  Guess  how  I  know  (check  my  police  reports).  But  moving  the  Methadone  Clinique  will  not  make  the  news/  hard  work  for  this  administration.

__label__m _U  Yeah  -  numerous  forms  of  illicit  non-pharmaceutical  fentanyl,  numerous  benzodiazepines,  and  perhaps  a  drop  of  oxycodone.  And  this  will  go  down  as  a  "prescription  opioid  OD  death",  rather  than  an  illicit  fentanyl  and/or  polypharmacy  death.  This  is  criminal!!!!

__label__a where  the  adderall  plug
__label__m _U  if  sdlp  hadn't  gone  into  opposition  they  would  have  signed  their  own  political  dnr,  methadone  of  block  grant  eases  pain
__label__m So  do  rappers  spit  bars  about  Xanax  because  they  get  high  off  it  or  because  it  helps  with  anxiety  and  stress?
__label__a The  state  and  corporate  are  here  all  in  one  day.  My  boss  offered  me  Klonopin  twice.  How  are  all  your  days?
__label__m _U  _U  I  know  *EXACTLY*  where  you’re  coming  from,  mate.  I  won’t  touch  the  anxiolytics  the  NHS  doles  out  -  at  least  not  anymore  -  because  it’s  usually  risperidone  &  that  shit  has  a  VERY  low  tolerance  threshold.  There  are  far  better  alternatives  but,  obviously,  they’re  all  illegal
__label__c glad  i  ate  breakfast  today,  bc  i'm  poppin  valium  like  pez.  this  anxiety  isn't  leaving  and  i  can't  deal.

__label__m _U  _U  Methadone  is  used  to  treat  pain  in  palliative  care  and  hospice  patients,  it  is  effective  in  treating  different  types  of  pain,  so  it  can  be  especially  helpful  in  treating  neuropathic  pain  when  gabapentin  no  longer  is  managing  it.  Just  wanted  to  add  this  point.
__label__m somebody  feed  me  xanax  because  car  shopping  is  giving  me  so  much  anxiety  right  now  i  can't.
__label__c don’t  you  love  it  when  u  feel  extra  sleepy  at  work  due  to  this  lil  0.5mg  xanax  but  the  stronger  ones  don’t  work  at  all  when  u  need  to  chill  and  sleep  and

__label__a _U  _U  Yeah  I  know  bout  the  2mg  I  use  to  be  into  xanax  but  i  got  in  legal  troubles  and  you  kjowbwhat  that  leads  to
__label__a trazedone,  hydroxyzine  and  seroquel  don't  make  me  tired
__label__m future  pronounces  adderall  oddly
__label__m when  someone  calls  xanax  an  opiate  🙄  pick  up  a  fucking  book  before  you  try  to  "educate"
__label__m i'm  about  to  just  make  vyvanse
__label__m If  u  listen  closely  during  putp  u  can  hear  trav  drop  a  single  tear  of  joy  when  quavo  says  “Percocet  and  codeine  please  dont  take  my  life.”
__label__m have  general  forgetfulness?you  probably  have  skitzo.this  causes  skin  to  turn  orange.try  methadone
__label__a _U  i  was  on  H,  xanax,  3-fpm,  adderall,  copious  amounts  of  clonazolam  n  2  strong  hits  of  LSD
__label__c just  got  that  valium  though.  about  to  sleep  good  as  hell.
__label__m "_U:  a  coffee  and  a  20mg  peach  adderall  in  the  morning  is  legal  cocaine"
__label__c _U  Even  with  medication,  mental  illness  still  messes  with  my  life.  But  not  as  severely,  and  not  as  often.  Without  medication  (citalopram,  clonazapam,  lamotrigine),  I  wouldn't  be  here.  With  it,  my  track  record  for  surviving  bad  days  is  still  100%.  Better  living  through  chemistry!

__label__m _U  _U  _U  I  once  found  some  50yr  old  morphine  in  my  grandfather’s  stash  from  his  doctoring  days.  Suspect  that  might  have  been  a  bit  *too*  old...
__label__m _U  you'd  have  to  drug  me  w/  enough  xanax  for  an  army  and  then  drag  me
__label__c _U  i  went  through  klonopin  withdrawal  the  next  far  so  i  couldn't  even  look  in  a  mirror  and  now  my  skin  is  too  dry  to  work  on
__label__c xanax  is  disgusting,  that  is  all
__label__c low  attention  span  so  these  adderall  work
__label__m Flex  on  Aderall  Sex  on  Tramadol
__label__c they  just  injected  morphine  into  me  😳
__label__m _U  lyrica  can  cause  weight  i  think  but  i  believe  it  works  very  well.  i've  heard,  never  been  on  it.  and  cymbalta  is  the  devil  lol
__label__m _U  The  xanax  comment?  I  was  unable!!  You  know  how  many  times  we'd  have  to  put  him  outside  too?!?  😂😂

__label__a _U  xanax  is  good!  you  can  get  one  from  vanessa.
__label__c I  dropped  my  lorazepam  on  the  floor,  butter  side  down
__label__c the  last  time  i  went  to  the  er,  they  gave  me  hydrocodone.  it  didn't  help  at  all  for  pain.  oxycodone  gets  the  job  done  :^)
__label__m Is  there  a  certain  thinking  about  it  and  I  remembered  that  are  on  the  90s  this  drug  came  out  called  oxycodone.
__label__c Geeze  8  diazepam  and  let  me  chill  out  and  get  this  essay  finished
__label__m To  the  ignorant  conspiracy  nuts    commenting  about  Yulia  Skripal.  Antidotes  called,  atropine,  pralidoxime,  and  diazepam  CAN  be  LIFESAVING  when  poisoned  with  Novichok.  However,  recovery  can't  be  certain  afterwards  because  of  long  term  health  issues.
__label__m _U  No  dispute  there.  Just,  at  the  time,  FF  was  our  methadone,  if  you'll  pardon  the  expression
__label__m _U  This  whole  thing  has  become  so  incredibly  baroque  I  think  you  have  to  have  an  Adderall  scrip  to  even  begin  to  understand  it
__label__c xanax  will  make  you  feel  down  if  you  have  anxiety  which  i  do,  but  it  counteracts  with  my  depression  so  it  makes  me  neutral/happy
__label__c _U  Yes  but  have  been  on  Klonopin  for  years.  It  stays  in  your  system  longer  but  all  benzodiazepines  can  cause  dementia  so  trying  to  cut  back
__label__m i  feel  like  ive  taken  a  bunch  of  adderall  im  so  fucking  focused  and  awake  right  now  holy  shit

__label__c I'm  only  21  but  I  honestly  feel  like  taking  gabapentin  has  ruined  my  life.  I'm  ready  to  be  done  now.  How  far  away  are  my  70s/80s/90s?

__label__m If  you  can  get  through  the  withdrawals  your  life  will  be  real  beautiful  not  fake  beautiful.  But  if  you’re  like  most  people  (like  93%)  and  you  can  never  seem  to  get  off  and  stay  off  because  it’s  too  close  to  your  life,  get  on  methadone  or  suboxone.  That  way  you  get  stable  and  real

__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  heroine,  morphine...  I’m  feeling  all  the  highs,  feeling  all  the  pain.    Not  thinking  straight,  suddenly  it’s  intoxicating
__label__c Well,  bouncing  from  this,  to  wanting  to  cut  myself,  because,  let’s  face  it,  it’s  anxiolytic.      I  really  need  a  bar  of  Xanax,  but  I  don’t  have  any
__label__m xanax  will  make  you  black  out  with  zero  alcohol  lol  no  thanks

__label__c I  take  seroquel  every  night  to  help  combat  their  attempts  at  sleep  deprivation.  All  the  2nd  gen  antipsychotics  do  is  bind  to  certain  serotonin  and  dopamine  receptors.  I  also  take  remeron,  trazodone,  phenibut,  and  sometimes  restoril.  They  are  great!

__label__a 4:07am  -  the  vyvanse  hasn't  worn  off  yet.
__label__m Not  completely.  But  the  amount  of  opioids  required  to  dull  it  alone  is  extreme.  The  addition  of  gabapentin  lowers  the  dosage  required.

I  had  labral  repair  on  my  shoulder  and  was  given  100  OxyContin  every  two  weeks.  That’s  not  how  those  meds  were  designed  to  be  prescribed.
__label__c at  any  rate,  valium  and  pasta  did  the  trick.

__label__c _U  Tramadol  won't  ever  touch  my  pain  level!!  23  surgeries  in  8  years.  But,  if  I  had  access  to  weed  I'd  be  much  better,  especially  for  my  seizures.

__label__c _U  they  should  be  doing  what  the  patient  wants!  i  find  olanzapine  great!  it  did  make  me  fat  though  😔  but  my  moods  are  great.

__label__c Once  again,  I'm  getting  the  same  old  bullshit  from  Kaiser  Fresno  Pharmacy  B  about  my  Lyrica  refill.  Just  once,  I'd  like  to  get  my  Lyrica  refills  filled  hassle-free.      What  a  fucking  nightmare!

__label__c i  only  have  four  more  oxycodone  how  am  i  going  to  make  it  through  the  day
__label__m Good  for  that  Russ  guy  to  stand  out  against  Xanax  like  that,  that  shit  is  not  okay  to  mess  with.  It  fucks  you  up  in  more  ways  than  one

__label__a Seroquel  munchies  are  absolutely  real  I  always  thought  it  was  a  joke
__label__m This  was  a  facetious  example  but  if  you  replace  S+V  and  C+O  with  oxycodone  and  oxybutynin  you  get  the  idea.  In  fact,  the  change  of  colour  scheme  becomes  more  dangerous  as  you  see  it's  blue  and  says  oxy--  on  it  so  assume  it  oxycodone  even  if  the  colours  scheme  has  changed.  13/n

__label__a How  much  xanax  is  too  much?  I've  gobbled  down  10  percocets  in  a  day.  Got  a  high  tolerance  for  shit  like  this.  I've  heard  someone  say  it's  possible  to  smoke  too  much  weed,  but  i  never  found  a  limit  myself.  #goodatdrugs
__label__m holy  morphine
__label__m _U  diacetylmorphine  1st  synthesised  london  1874.  bayer  germany  1998  began  marketing  as  ‘heroin’,  said  it  was  safer  than  morphine

__label__c _U  for  real-  i'm  reaching  for  the  diazepam  right  now  ;)  lol!!!
__label__m my  tweet  was  wrong  the  other  day.  any  doctor  can  prescribe  suboxone  if  they  pass  a  dea  test,  most  don't  want  2  deal  w/  "junkies"  though  #sad
__label__c _U  same  he  gave  me  the  smallest  dose  after  he  experimented  on  me  with  klonopin  and  prozac  to  disastrous  results

__label__c i  really  need  to  take  my  adderall  every  day
__label__m _U  been  on  olanzapine  long?
__label__m _U  cheese  has  casein  in  it  which  has  the  same  effect  on  our  brains  as  morphine.  it’s  the  hardest  to  let  go  for  most  people,  it  does  not  mean  you’re  not  serious  about  veganism.  you’re  doing  great😊  good  luck  with  your  transition,  it  doesn’t  matter  how  long  it  takes.

__label__m rhiannon  lassiter  (_U)'s  waking  dream  is  a  brilliant  fantasy  novel  that  almost  reads  like  a  deconstruction  of  a  morphine  high.
__label__m _U  morphine  that  is
__label__c i  swear  codeine  or  xanax  today.
__label__m Morphine  activate
__label__c _U  lyrica  caused  me  6  months  of  depression

__label__c _U  diazepam  is  an  addictive  benzo.  it's  ok  short  term.  i  find  sleep  &  meditation  gives  me  peace  &  calm.  when  i  can  get  it.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  And  the  most  commonly  prescribed  non-opiod  painkiller  (in  my  experience)  is  tramadol,  which  can  cause  SEVERE  adverse  reactions  in  people  w/even  mild  mental  health  issues,  pharmacologically  treated  or  not.

__label__c Morphine  hits  the  spot
__label__c I’m  still  so  fucking  anxious!    Got  to  pop  a  pill  of  valium  again?!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Ouch...I've  had  to  convert  patients  to  IR  because  of  the  ridiculous  cost,  which  is  a  double  edged  sword  because  now  there  are  that  many  more  adderall  pills  floating  around.  It's  a  no  win  for  the  patient.
__label__m _U  that  was  not  annie  hall  or  diane  keaton  that  needed  the  valium  but  i  do  now  thanks
__label__m _U  suboxone  for  opiate  dependent  individuals  does  not  make  them  high-so  the  reason  is  self  medication.
__label__m Small  brain:  Love  lil  pump      Med  Brain:  Xanax  rappers,  auto  tune  are  ruining  hip  hop!  Argh!  I  miss  rap  from  the  Clinton  administration!    Big  brain:  we  can  listen  to  all  kinds  of  hip  hop  and  enjoy  them    Biggest  brain:  trippie  redd  is  the  only  relevant  artist  in  the  world.
__label__m _U  Do  they  have  a  physician?  Many  will  give  free  samples.  If  generic  some  of  those  meds  are  cheap  even  without  insurance.  Xanax  generic  runs  about  $10  for  a  bottle.    What  medication  does  your  friend  need?
__label__m _U  _U  _U  the  uninformed  would  think  that  the  story  was  saying  suboxone  clinics  are  equal  to  pill  mills.
