__label__m Hurricane  #Irma  upgraded  back  to  a  Category-5  storm;  maximum  sustained  winds  160  mph.      Can  someone  get  this  chick  a  xanax  or  soemthin????
__label__c _U  I'm  on  100mg  of  Pristiq  as  well  as  I'm  on  Tramadol  which  boosts  serotonin  levels,  I'm  a  fucking  monster  mate

__label__m _U  _U  "innovation  isn't  as  likely"  is  a  massive  understatement  btw.  The  only  popular  consumer  products  that  the  USSR  invented  were  the  Rubik's  cube,  Tetris  and  Fanta  Orange  drink.  And  methadone  if  you  want  to  include  that.
__label__m “_U:  99.3%  of  the  world's  hydrocodone  is  used  in  the  united  states.  😳  #ascp15  #dea”  wow!
__label__m right  now  i  feel  like  i've  taken  a  moderate  dose  of  morphine  and  am  just  holding  it  together.
__label__a I  found  a  very  small  amount  of  lorazepam  I’d  forgotten  about  and  am  functioning  wonderfully  today  🌞
__label__m _U  dude.  worst  thing  on  athletic  ability  is  drugs  like  prozac  or  xanax.  especially  if  you  drink.  turns  minds  into  mush  and  unathletic.
__label__c _U  klonopin  for  the  win  glad  i  have  those  too  for  when  i  get  anxiety.
__label__m _U  I  feel  like  I  need  a  Xanax  or  equivalent  first!!
__label__c i'm  so  happy  adderall  exists  😌
__label__m percocet  and  codeine  please  take  my  life  😩
__label__a I  was  addicted  to  hydrocodone  and  fentenyl.  A  bad  accident  30  years  ago  alot  of  pain  every  day.    I  looked  at  my  life  and  realized  I  couldn’t  be  whole  with  my  pain  meds  So  I  stopped  them!  Where  is  the  mental  fortitude  USA?  Yes  it  was  hellacious!  It’s  also  worth  it.  Even  with  pain
__label__a i've  never  done  coke,  but  adderall  with  coffee  is  fucking  awesome!!!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  I’ve  heard  it’s  agony.  But  6  of  morphine  is  like  a  paediatric  dose  😳  (this  is  not  medical  advice!)
__label__a _U  adderall  had  me  bringing  a  vacuum  cleaner  to  the  desert  _U
__label__a _U  That’s  not  really  fair  since  You  two  didn’t  go  to  sleep  with  all  the  adderall  and  coke  flying  around  in  Minnesota!

__label__m _U  If  I  was  him  and  get  convicted,  I’d  get  some  drugs  before  going  to  Jail  and  kill  myself.    OD  on  Xanax.

__label__m _U  _U  Is  that  why  when  patients  count  their  scripts  under  the  camera  before  they  leave  due  to  being  shorted  a  few  films  nothing  is  done?    And  this  is  after  the  tech  announces  in  front  of  all  the  patients  with  no  privacy  at  all  that  they  are  on  Suboxone?
__label__a _U  My  husband  had  a  work  injury  in  2006.  He  has  3  herniated  discs  in  his  back  and  a  TBI.  He’s  been  on  oxycodone  since  2006  bc  his  back  is  too  bad  to  do  surgery.  He  also  goes  for  injections  in  his  back  every  3  months.  Between  the  Oxycodone  and  the  TBI  he  has  become  very  abusive.
__label__m _U  but  not  before  refilling  his  Oxycontin  &  Percocet  at  Walgreens.
__label__m _U  he  must  have  left  his  adderall  at  home  again
__label__c adderall  had  me  picking  crumbs  up  off  the  floor  one  by  one

__label__m I  was  talking  to  my  mom  how  bipolar  this  weather  is  and  she  goes  “This  weather  needs  Xanax  to  calm  down”  😂😂😂
__label__m _U  _U  and  mumble  all  their  bars  cuz  everyone's  fucked  up  on  lean,  xanax  and  mollys
__label__a adderall  protip:  drink  an  alkali  beverage  (baking  soda  in  water)  before  you  take  it  to  amplify  the  effect.  acidic  beverages  do  the  opposite.  i’m  fuckin  zoomin  rn
__label__c Me  when  I  don't  take  adderall:  I  don't  need  it!  I  can  be  independent  from  medications!      Me  when  I  do:  HOW  DID  I  EVER  FUNCTION  WITHOUT
__label__u Lyrica  Anderson  really  cold
__label__a _U  _U  100%!  give  me  valium  over  booze  any  day  of  the  week  haha
__label__m Also,  "4eva  is  a  Mighty  Long  Time"  -  Big  KRIT  was  easily  the  best  hip  hop  album  of  the  past  year,  but  the  south  gets  no  respect  unless  you  mumble  about  Xanax....  terrible
__label__c I  had  an  inoperable  neck  condition  6  years  ago.  I  took  vicodin  and  oxycontin  for  3  years  as  prescribed.  I  weaned  off  over  a  period  of  6  weeks  after  having  therapy  for  my  neck.  I  am  not  now  nor  was  I  ever  addicted.  Pain  medication  is  for  responsible  adults.  What  about  alcoholism?
__label__m _U  Nooo  she  looks  like  she  smells  like  Xanax
__label__c _U  off  adderall  had  me  looking  up  videos  like  that
__label__m My  grandmother  was  making  a  list  for  my  21st  of  alcoholic  beverages  categorized  as  “these  make  me  tipsy”  and  “you’ll  feel  these  in  the  morning”  in  front  of  my  mother.      I’ve  come  to  the  conclusion  that    we  will  need  to  stock  up  on  her  Ativan  for  Armageddon  this  summer.
__label__c god  bless  gabapentin  for  curing  my  restless  legs  👏🏻
__label__m _U  LOL  bruh  take  a  Xanax,  it’s  Twitter
__label__m I  been  up,  &  I  ain't  have  to  take  no  adderall.

__label__a Speaking  from  exp.,  I  was  prescribed  120  oxycontin  and  240  oxyocodone  each  month.  I  was  no  doubt  hooked.  When  fed  gov.  got  involved,  Dr  took  me  off  cold  turkey.  Withdraws  were  horrible,  thought  I  was  going  to  die  but  never  once  crossed  my  mind  to  buy  off  street.  I  had  a  choice!
__label__c Anyone  take  #seroquel?  I  take  25mg  lowest  dose...I  think.  Idk  how  people  take  more  than  200mg!!!  I'm  knocked  out  with  one.

__label__m _U  Out  of  Adderall  (amphetamine/smart  drug)  or  -  more  plainly  blood  sugar?  Likely  he  is  on  something  (few  varieties)  quite  regularly.
__label__m _U  _U  Valium  is  a  really  lousy  choice  for  an  anti  anxiety  med.  There’s  a  lot  better  ones  now.
__label__m _U  _U  It  was  only  a  few  weeks  ago  that  the  Tories  refused  pairing  which  gave  us  the  spectacle  of  labour  mp's  attending  in  a  state  of  very  poor  health,  in  wheelchairs,  on  morphine.    There  is  a  pattern  here,  Tories  governing  for  themselves  not  country
__label__c In  that  time,  i  quit  clonazepam  (rivotril)  on  January  i  quit  smoking.  When  drawing  a  pic  a  day  got  easier,  it  never  felt  difficult  again.
__label__c _U  i  bet!  upset  tums  are  just  diabolical.  thnk  gawd  loperamide  is  available  whn  required!  i  still  remember  kaolin  &  morphine!

__label__m _U  My  dear  lady  try  a  Valium.  It  might  help.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  I  watched  CSPAN  2  until  I  felt  sick.  In  bed  now  after  taking  a  Xanax.  Fight  again  tomorrow.
__label__a i've  had  a  headache  all  day  so  i  think  i've  got  to  alter  the  klonopin  to  adderall  ratio  the  next  time  i  make  another  "final  countdown".
__label__a lol  i  just  found  an  adderall  in  my  pocket  what  even
__label__c _U  I  ❤️  klonopin.  Used  to  take  it  as  needed  for  anxiety  attacks.

__label__m _U  _U  As  USA  battles  with  failed  &  futile  PUD  (Prohibition  Use  Disorder)  OST  with  methadone  or  buprenorphine  keeps  a  lot  of  people  alive,  reduces  crime  &  HIV,  helps  many  families.  Never  get  adequate  OST  coverage  unless  lots  GPs  also  provide.  Great  article
__label__m @kpunk99  @lowquay  ah,  yes.  heroin  as  'cure'  for  opium,  then  cocaine  cure  for  heroin,  now  methadone  as  cure  for  h  &amp;  prozac  the  cure  for  life.
__label__m Every  fucking  mnemonic  these  days  is  adderall.  Everyone  is  chanting  it.  It's  got  me  fasting  without  hunger  all  day  -  Steve  #mnemonics  #slots

__label__c Poping  a  Xanax  really  does  help  with  anxiety  when  you're  not  out  there  trying  to  abusing  them.
__label__c Yesterday  I  got  off  work  and  ALL  I  WANTED  WAS  SOME  XANAX  but  waking  up  this  morning  at  8  am  not  groggy  and  not  pissed  about  nothing,  I’m  glad  I  didn’t.

__label__c i  realized  adderall  has  successfully  replaced  the  way  i  used  caffeine  beginning  year  two  (sterling)  nt
__label__a I  actually  slept  pretty  well  last  night  after  taking  twice  the  amount  of  Xanax  that  I  take  to  quell  a  panic  attack  (one  Xanax  doesn't  really  help  me  sleep).  I  hope  this  doesn't  become  a  regular  thing.  I've  gotten  by  with  only  needing  it  once  or  twice  a  week  thus  far.
__label__m _U  "Oh,  you  mean  quetiapine!  Yes,  it  cures  everything."
__label__c I  took  one  Norco  when  I  got  my  wisdom  teeth  out  and  I  fell  asleep  so  abruptly  I  bit  my  tongue  like  WDYM  you  had  codeine  morphine  and  THC  how  are  you  awake??
__label__m _U  _U  Hope  it  works  for  you.  Keep  me  informed.  Strong  beer  and  Tramadol  appeal  more  in  the  meantime  than  that  torture  !!
__label__a when  you  have  a  high  percent  of  hydrocodone  but  you  so  use  to  it  .  you  just  high    &  not  at  all  sleepy&gt;&gt;&gt;
__label__c _U  no  worries.  i  have  to  go  to  get  methadone  anyway.  but  i  think  we're  usually  on  the  same  page  about  most  things.  ;)
__label__c _U  I  didn't  know  what  was  going  on  I  know  I  had  twins  but  that's  as  far  as  it  gets  morphine  blew  my  mind  lol  x
__label__a im  dying  right  now  but  i  already  took  twice  the  maximum  dose  of  painkillers  and  if  i  mix  it  with  oxycontin  i  could  overdose  😭😭

__label__m _U  u  should  probably  learn  how  to  spell  xanax  before  taking  it...😕
__label__m _U  _U  _U  His  record  label/  crew  name  ...  stands  for  ecstasy  and  oxycontin
__label__c So  I  let  Amy  stay  over  after  Scott  cheated  on  her  and  this  whore  of  a  slut  took  all  my  Xanax.
__label__a finna  pour  up  a  script  of  vyvanse  70
__label__c that  oxycodone  really  wears  off  after  four  hours.  😒
__label__m You  might  consider  taking  up  yoga  &  meditation  &  reiki  &  crystal  healing  &  shiatsu  &  primal  screaming  &  cucumber  facials  &  stress  balls  &  valium  &  siestas  &  lounging  &  navel  gazing  &  whale  sound  compositions?    idk  how  your  head  hasn't  already  imploded  from  such  gung-ho  intensity
__label__m How  do  ppl  function  on  seroquel?
__label__m This  whole  abusing  xanax,  an  anti-panic  medication,  while  not  diagnosed  with  shit,  for  some  garbage-ass  aesthetic,  needs  to  fucking  stop.
__label__m "that  girl  is  bobbin  for  apples  at  the  methadone  clinic  every  day"  ***me;  really  thinking  they  have  the  game  bob  for  apples  🍎

__label__c tf  when  u  mean  to  take  two  klonopin  4  stress  b4  bed  but  u  accidentally  take  two  ritalin  and  now  ur  anxious  and  wide  awake
__label__c _U  _U  How  the  fuck  could  he  even  get  on  his  bike  with  the  tramadol?  I've  only  taken  it  once,for  post-op  pain  relief  and  i  was  on  a  different  planet.
__label__m _U  i  don't  mean  to  tell  you  what  to  do  but  remind  that  latuda  or  abilify  really  help  neutralize  the  sad.  #happycunt
__label__m _U  _U  and  if  you'd  got  morphine  like  i  said  you  could've  been  out.  teach  you  not  to  listen  😁
__label__c the  waitress  told  me  good  morning,  and  i  said  it's  good  because  i  finally  slept  without  using  anesthesia  and  i  took  my  800mg  of  klonopin  :)
__label__c i'm  tapering  off  klonopin  and  it's  a  slower/more  unpleasant  process  than  i  expected
__label__m Family  confirm  british  national  Laura  Plummer,33,  is  sentenced  to  3  years  in  jail  in  #Egypt  -  she  was  arrested  for  bringing  Tramadol  into  the  country
__label__c so...    i'm  mildly  allergic  to  morphine.    hydrocodone,  which  they  gave  me  for  my  teeth,  is  a  morphine  derivative.  never  had  a  problem  before.

__label__m the  parking  lot  of  the  methadone  clinic  across  from  my  work,  is  far  more  entertaining  than  any  series  on  netflix  right  now.
__label__m Once  again  these  overdose  deaths  are  from  illicit  drugs  and  or  street  drugs.  Not  prescribed  opiates.  I’ve  been  interviewing  in  some  clinics    (methadone)  and  the  overall  %  interviews  tell  me  if  they  started  from  opiates  it  was  bought,stolen,given  but  very  few  Rec’d  opiates  from  Rx
__label__c i  don't  take  xanax  anymore  but  i  could  really  use  one  rn
__label__m did  someone  slip  an  adderall  in  my  coffee  or  what
__label__m you’re  just  a  kid  smoking  cigarettes  the  adderall  is  drenched  in  alcohol  so  let  you’ll  let  your  lungs  fill  up  with  the  comfort  of  smoke

__label__m _U  _U  Perhaps  you  should  take  a  Valium.  You’re  going  to  blow  an  artery.  So  if  Canada  was  obligated  hto  “protect”  khadr,  was  it  not  then  obligated  to  protect  2  non  criminal  journalists  in  the  Philippines?

__label__a let  a  visiting  french  girl  stay  at  my  place  while  i'm  dog  sitting.  she  texts  me  that  she's  leaving  &  "i  left  you  a  surprise".  i  was  like  cool,  must  be  weed.  got  home  &  she  did  indeed  leave  weed...  along  with  5  mdma  pills  &  a  xanax,  are  all  french  people  this  extra???
__label__m _U  Xanax  got  him
__label__m my  dads  stoned  off  of  valium  and  lost  in  the  hospital
__label__m _U  if  two  tramadol  and  two  codeine  don't  shift  it  then  girl  you  need  some  serious  pain  relief,  ask  your  doc  for  temgesic  x
__label__m _U  Come  to  Santa  Monica,  where  you  can  visit  random  non-franchise  pharmacies  and  Adderall  abounds
__label__m _U  _U  No  ones  gonna  likely  overdose  and  die  from  Xanax  it’s  nearly  impossible.  If  it’s  laced  with  fentanyl  then  yes  you  can  die.
__label__m _U  ali  as  after  his  first  xanax
__label__c adderall  at  1  pm  is  never  a  good  idea  when  you  want  to  sleep  at  a  normal  time.  #hyped  #cantsleep  #killmenow
__label__a the  last  time  i  took  valium  i  felt  like  i  was  spinning  every  time  i  closed  my  eyes.  it  was  interesting
__label__a on  so  much  adderall  i'm  going  to  be  up  for  the  next  three  days
__label__m is  xanax  like  the  new  "cool"  drug  ppl  be  doing  now  or  what?
__label__u Lyrica  pretty  to  but  her  hair  be  fucked  up  🤦🏽‍♂️
__label__c and  i'm  really  tired  of  doctors  treating  me  like  i'm  unreasonable  to  want  better.  i'm  not  drug  seeking  or  asking  for  miracles.  but  tramadol
__label__m i  need  to  many  klonopin
__label__c Feeling  very  uneasy  in  the  library  right  now  either  because  the  adderall  just  hit  me  or  because  this  very  cute  girl  sat  next  to  me    Hmmm  probably  both
__label__m _U  _U  But  do  they  contain  Xanax...
__label__c To  find  the  right  cocktail  of  meds  &  dosage  are  hard.  Dah  try  byk  sampai  tak  igt  dah  combination  meds&dosage  nya.  Pernah  try  zoloft,  seroquel,  seroquel  xr,  xanapam,  lithium,  lorazepam,  midazolam,  escitalopram.  Now  on  epilim  chrono  only  (1.5  gram).  So  far  it  seems  working  for  me.
__label__c _U  They  gave  me  Valium  or  something  when  I  had  mine  so  it  didn’t  seem  that  bad.  But  just  the  thought  of  the  procedure  makes  me  cringe.
__label__c _U  try  valium  it  works  wonders

__label__c i've  been  having  to  take  xanax  some  nights  for  my  anxiety  again  and  it  sucks
__label__m _U  that  will  happen  when  you're  on  adderall

__label__c _U  Just  had  knee  replacement.  Oxycodone  and  Tramadol  aren't  cutting  for  pain.  Suggestions?

__label__a i  wanna  pop  a  xanax  but  then  i'm  gonna  sleep  til  tuesday  &  na...
__label__c _U  morphine  isn't  even  that  good  compared  to  what  they  gave  me
__label__m RIP  Lil  Peep....mfs  need  to  get  off  xanax,  they  do  you  nooooo  good  😑💔

__label__m this  girl  was  actually  decent  looking  until  she  started  relying  on  xanax  as  an  every  day  drug  lmfao
__label__c Hello  Valium,  my  old  friend.    I’ve  come  to  eat  you  up  again.
__label__a nigga  it's  420  everyday.  dabs  in  the  am  vyvanse  for  the  work  day  and  late  night  then  some  more  medication  for  sleeping.  my  daily  routine.
__label__m _U  Had  to  lmao  that  extension  ,  the  injury  ,  and  no  adderall  we  need  the  old  joe
__label__m _U  if  i  really  had  to  go  with  one,  id  say  morphine  tbh
__label__a you  know  how  tramadol  makes  normal  people  feel  drowsy???  nope  not  me.  feel  like  i'm  tripping  😂
__label__c _U  I  truly  believe  the  same  I  was  on  Fentnyl  which  is  a  synthetic  heroin  and  I’m  on  morphine  for  chronic  pain  now  Mr  Sessions  attacks  a  natural  drug  God  put  on  this  planet  that  could  help  me  Cancer  patients  it’s  ridiculous  the  Government  needs  to  wake  up

__label__c _U  bum.    i  was  worried  about  mania  on  them,  but  i  think  the  biffiness  is  going  to  be  worse,  especially  coupled  with  quetiapine.
__label__c Forgot  my  Pregabalin  🙄    Basically  means  that  this  afternoon  I'll  have  similar  pains  in  my  face  to  when  you're  at  the  dentist  and  they  touch  a  nerve  in  your  tooth.    FML
__label__c _U  I  used  to  take  too  high  of  a  dose  of  Abilify  and  even  taking  it  at  night  (which  usually  can  help  with  not  experiencing  too  much  drowsiness)  i  was  like  sleeping  through  multiple  alarms  in  the  morning  and  couldnt  be  awake  like  more  than  3  hours  at  a  time
__label__m i  gave  that  bitch  a  xanax.  bitches  love  xanax  😄

(I  feel  sorry  for  them  but  only  wish  them  the  worst.)
__label__m _U  _U  try  oxycodone
__label__a _U  valium  makes  me  loopy  😂😂
__label__c it's  okay  adderall  i  didn't  want  to  sleep  anyways
__label__m _U  Fibromyalgia?    May  a  pharmacist  (me)  suggest  a  rule-out  method  which  may  alleviate  some/all  of  your  pain?  Very  safe,  MAY  be  helpful,  may  not,  but  low  cost  and  I've  had  some  patients  have  astonishingly  positive  results,  even  getting  off  of  Gaba/Lyrica.
__label__c I  am  still  dying  in  the  waiting  room.  Did  you  know  that  valium  can  only  make  you  feel  slightly  less  stressed  but  not  cozy  if  your  base  stress  is  high  enough?
__label__m _U  buy  a  bottle  of  valium
__label__a imma  take  this  adderall  and  go  dummyyy  tonight
__label__m My  mom  has  been  on  Percocet  for  10  yrs  &  Oxycontin  for  5  yrs  for  her  severe  chronic  pain  from  working  40  yrs  &  lifting  heavy  items.      They  have  now  cut  her  off  from  Percocets  which  are  her  “break  through”  pills,  so  she  doesn’t  have  to  take  multiple  Oxys.  How  is  this  helping?
__label__m Have  those  who  say  laughter  is  the  best  medicine  tried  morphine?
__label__a i  found  an  adderall  from  10  years  ago  in  my  bedroom  and  it's  working  lol
__label__m Oxycontin..    has  an  old  friend  in  Fantasyland    😬
__label__m _U  Oh  c'mon,  that's  Knudepunkt  but  on  valium  and  with  business  cards...
__label__m _U  Try  asking  for  pregabalin,  that's  the  generic  formulation  of  Lyrica.
__label__m _U  Though  watching  #SWESUI  is  probably  more  effective  than  valium  for  calminf  nerves.  I  actually  nodded  off  in  the  1st  half.  Enjoy  tonight  #ENG  V  #COL
__label__a _U  and  some  xanax  .n  percocet  lol
__label__m have  difficulty  making  decisions?yes?you  suffer  from  melancholia.this  causes  denial.try  methadone
__label__m just  got  verbally  assaulted  over  oxycodone  🙃  i'm  bout  to  go  home  lmao
__label__m _U  _U  Williamson  hates  Trump  and  Trump  supporters  and  suggested  that  the  latter  needed  to  die  off  from  OxyContin  due  to  moral  hazard  or  something.  Death  to  whomever  is  kind  of  a  theme  with  Williamson
__label__a _U  Oh  still  great  behavior  you’re  encouraging  just  like  making  kwiz  snort  her  first  Xanax  supplied  by  you  but  wait  you’re  still  a  good  person  because  you  haven’t  done  it  since  June  even  though  I’ve  never  done  one  I’m  the  devil  -kat
__label__m _U  sebab  during  acute  episode  kita  bagi  morphine.  morphine  tends  to  induce  vomitting.
__label__m _U  opioids  are  mostly  used  as  painkillers  buddy,  like  morphine  and  codeine  and  so  on  :)
__label__c adderall  got  me  not  sleeping  fml
__label__c we're  getting  bad  thunder  storms  so  i'm  taking  a  xanax  and  going  to  bed
__label__m _U  This!She  didnt  cheat  on  anyone,  bang  anyone's  bf  or  throw  a  tantrum  while  blackout  drunk  on  xanax.  Watching  herself  gush  about  the  guy  who  broke  her  ❤  is  punishment  enough.  Can  we  just  move  on?!!
__label__m Can  you  take  2mg  of  xanex  and    (Zoloft)fluoxetine  (Prozac,  Sarafem)citalopram  (Celexa)escitalopram  (Lexapro)paroxetine    for  years  like  these  kids  compounded  with  negative  influences  from  every  direction  and  growing  destitution  after  high  school  wont  result  in  extreme  behavior
__label__m _U  and  for  fathers  of  two  teenage  daughters,  a  bottle  of  xanax
__label__m Hillary  hittin  that  Xanax  hard  right  now.
__label__a gotta  stop  poppin  these  pills...  xanax
__label__c i  swear  adderall  makes  you  get  everything  done😂😂
__label__a i'd  really  like  some  cymbalta  and  adderall...  not  prescribed  to  me  ofc.
__label__a apparently  people  say  i  sell  xanax  but  have  no  proof  lolololol  yeah  i  sell  thousands  of  dollars  worth  of  xanax  to  the  fucking  pope  lol
__label__c it's  really  bad  man  the  only  reason  im  even  functioning  at  all  right  now  is  because  ive  got  ear  plugs  in  both  my  ears  and  i  took  two  ativan.  if  this  doesn't  settle  down  im  going  to  lose  my  mind.
__label__c _U  Seroquel  is  GREAT.  A  lot  of  the  atypicals  are.  They're  100%  worth  it,  and  I  only  stopped  because  I  was  sleeping  -so  much-.  My  movement  disorder  was  unrelated,  and  Seroquel  didn't  affect  it  one  way  or  the  other,  but  there  are  early  signs  to  stop,  and  then  they  go  away.
__label__m _U  Don't  watch  the  videos  and  take  the  valium  they  offer  you  right  before  the  procedure.    I  had  it  done  8  years  ago  after  wearing  glasses  for  35+  years  and  it  was  the  best  experience.    Waking  up  the  next  morning  being  able  to  see  20/15  with  no  glasses  was  amazing.
__label__m _U  why  is  your  stage  name  “Lil  Xan”  if  you’re  against  Xanax?  that  makes  no  sense
__label__m _U  #nursehere  youre  looking  for  a  medication  in  the  class  of  "atypical  antipsychotics"  risperdal,  seroquel,  etc.

__label__m _U  Gov  has  stopped  the  prezcribi  g  ot  pain  medication  (opiode  narcotics)  because  it  interferes  with  their  profit  making  from  suboxone  and  other  addiction  meds,  I  see  no  difference  here,  gov  is  crooked  and  killing  for  a  profit
__label__m almost  all  of  mary's  interactions  with  her  med  staff  includes  her  ordering  very  high  doses  of  morphine  to  patients.  she's  probably  the  most  empathetic  er  physician  ever.
__label__a me:  do  you  have  any  adderall  "no  but  i  have  some  cocaine  and  heroin  if  you  want"
__label__c 🗣I  am  in  between  morphine  doses,  so  this  tweet  is  the  real  deal.🗣    I  can’t  recall  being  this  dependant  on  others  to  get  through  a  day.  The  severity  of  my  surgery  has  me  with  an  incision  from  hip  to  hip,  cutting  all  underneath,  so  the  simple  act  of  standing  is...complicated.  😆

__label__a not  even  the  adderall  could  energize  me  enough  to  stay  up  another  night

__label__m Fuck  lil  xan.  Can’t  say  you  want  people  to  stop  doing  drugs  when  your  name  is  literally  fucking  Xanax.  Just  wants  some  spotlight  and  attention  can’t  fuck  with  that  hoe  shit.  Really  want  to  stop  people  doing  drugs?  Stop  promoting  it  fucking  simple.  But  nah  would  rather  be  talk
__label__m _U  &lt;  Spellbound  he  is  by  the  voices,  their  delivery  of  his  next  divine  mission  cutting  through  the  morphine  fog.  As  abruptly  as  the  moment  beings,  it  ends.  Theo's  head  dipping  forward  as  if  the  puppeteer  suddenly  gave  slack  to  the  marionette's  &gt;
__label__a _U  I  wish  it  was  "baloney"  that  big  pharma  got  me  hooked  on  instead  of  OxyContin.  I  can  cold  turkey  baloney  for  ham  or  pastrami.
__label__c I'm  mad  my  bf  won't  move  from  the  lounge  chair  I  want  to  sit  in  next  to  the  Himalayan  salt  lamp  but  I  took  an  Ativan  so
__label__a if  someone  could  hook  me  up  with  some  hydrocodone  that  would  be  clutch  cause  this  bitch  can't  move
__label__c Lack  of  Adderall  today  is  making  me  overly  emotional  and  craving  attention.  Avoiding  whining  on  Facebook  and  bugging  people.  But  still  making  a  public  post  somewhere  because  I'm  lame  #adhdproblems
__label__c i  gave  myself  an  hour  to  stop  crying  before  i  called  it.  no  work.  a  klonopin  and  a  cup  of  coffee,  though.
__label__m _U  _U  Well  she  must  have  been  told  to  get  tramadol  from  someone

__label__c I  dont  go  to  sleep  when  I  get  tired  you  can  see  the  adderall  in  my  eyes
__label__m can  someone  please  give  elliott  some  seroquel  or  something
__label__m ._U  how  is  this  debate  in  2016?  congress  is  being  evil  here.  actually  evil-  protecting  oxycontin  profits  at  expense  of  science/knowledge
__label__a why  tf  i  keep  seein  followers  ion  remember  following  😤  ether  my  twitter  trippin  or  i  needa  lay  off  the  xanax  😂
__label__c Lorazepam  today?  Maybe  not.
__label__c oxycodone  sucks  on  many  levels.  not  a  fan.  hope  to  be  able  to  get  off  of  it  soon.
__label__m Oh  nice,  Just  got  offered  a  load  of  speed  and  valium.  Stay  classy  scarborough.  Not  even  7am  ffs...
__label__m BREAKING:  White  House  officials  announced  they  have  spiked  _U  Diet  Coke  with  Lorazepam,  taken  his  phone,  and  locked  him  in  the  state  broom  closet  in  preparation  for  tonight’s  interview  with  former  FBI  Director  James  Comey  on  ABC.
__label__c really  wish  i  knew  where  my  mom  hid  my  vyvanse  😅😅😅
__label__c Why  is  it  so  HARD!  I  put  an  emergency  prescription  in  for  my  pregabalin  last  week.  Went  to  get  today  even  though  ill.  Nothing  has  been  done.  I’m  going  round  in  ever  decreasing  circles  and  I  just  want  people  to  help  me  a  little  by  doing  their  jobs!  Not  a  lot  surely??    GRUMP  😡
__label__m why  would  you  want  that  scum  to  be  a  dad  to  your  child  he  looks  like  he's  on  methadone  :-/  #jeremykyle
__label__m ya  come  home  from  college  &  everyone's  addicted  to  xanax  ok
__label__a Thank  God  government  are  working  radically  on  this  codiene  or  tramadol  issue  with  schoochees....  It's  killing  our  youths..      STOP  IT..  IT  KILLED  MY  IMMEDIATE  YOUNGER  BROTHER.  SO  I  AM  AGAINST  IT!    _U  _U
__label__m _U  How  can  anyone  access  that  amount  of  tramadol  even  in  UK
__label__m _U  did  you  have  to  much  adderall  yesterday  or  something?
__label__a this  adderall  got  me  fucked  up  making  me  wanting  to  do  chores  and  shit
__label__a poppin  adderall  like  its  candy
__label__m _U  stop  focusing  on  twitter  you  need  to  use  your  adderall  wisely
__label__m Y’all  still  poppin  xanax  and  sippin  lean  in  2018?  Y’all  childish  lol
__label__m Anyway  i  got  told  today  it  from  her  head  she  thought  i  had  25  miligram  methadone  the  other  day  plus  heartbeat  lowering  &  blood  pressure  lowering  medications  ...  She  was  not  certain  but  she  said  i  believe  you  had  25mg  methadone  from  what  i  recall  ..
__label__m _U  No  doctor  can  write  you  a  prescription  for  acetylfentanyl.  It  is  a  street  drug.  And  highly  fatal.  Fentanyl  alone  is  used  often  in  hospice  patients,  as  it  is  still  stronger  than  morphine  and  dangerous.  My  grandmother  and  uncle  were  both  in  hospice  with  fentanyl  patches
__label__a "what  about  getting  high  on  xanax?"  I've  tried  taken  2mg  of  it  and  it's  enough  to  make  me  fall  asleep.  you'd  be  more  relaxed,  a  lil  euphoria
__label__c Seroquel  is  the  best  sleep  medicine  period
__label__m I'm  like  the  Hamburglar  but  for  klonopin.
__label__m "every  form  of  addiction  is  bad,  no  matter  whether  the  narcotic  be  alcohol,  morphine  or  #idealism."  ―carl  jung  #socialism
__label__c _U  _U  feel  like  my  life  is  100x  better  since  upping  my  dose  from  20  to  40  altho  i  have  quetiapine  as  well  so  may  be  diff
__label__m _U  Bow  to  the  xanax  gods
__label__m _U  i  hope  this  customer  is  hot,  single,  and  not  on  olanzapine  or  valtrex.
__label__c night  one  on  seroquil  and  i'm  pretty  sure  i  slept  like  14  hours
__label__m _U  _U  _U  ikr?  might  as  well  just  take  the  whole  bottle  of  xanax  and  drink  the  6  boxes  of  wine  in  her  fridge  now.  😂
__label__a tbh  i  wanna  do  an  experiment  and  see  how  long  i  can  function  normally  with  just  adderall  and  water  no  food  i  think  2  and  a  half  days.
__label__c _U  No  I  take  valium  in  the  4th  quarters
__label__c took  my  last  klonopin  before  the  bus  ride  so  the  next  few  hours  are  gonna  be  blessed
__label__c i  took  an  adderall  and  my  wig  is  flying
__label__m “_U:  why'd  i  take  that  adderall  last  night”  haha  bet  you  got  no  sleep
__label__m Our  hospitals  are  known  nationwide  for  the  care  they  provide.  Nearly  all  11  ERs  offer  Buprenorphine  medication  assisted  treatment  on  demand.  Nearly  all  offer  peer  recovery  specialists.    #Healthwatch  _U  #LevelsofCare
__label__m this  lady  in  my  class  is  so  high  on  xanax  she's  even  asking  what  a  vaccine  is...this  is  why  i  hate  school  sometimes  😒
__label__c forgot  my  fucking  ativan  oml  🙄
__label__a _U  about  to  pop  an  adderall  just  to  find  kanyes  head
__label__c vyvanse  got  me  wide  awake  at  4am
__label__m @oliviavisdope  they  put  me  on  zoloft  today,  but  she  said  if  it  doesn't  work  i  can  try  xanax  hahaa  i  had  vyvanse  when  i  was  a  kid
__label__a that's  exactly  what  i  need  right  now  “_U:  adderall  and  redbull”
__label__m _U  50lbs  😳  OMG!!!!    That’s  crazy.  It’s  supposed  to  be  weight  neutral.  Did  u  lose  the  weight  after  stopping  Gabapentin
__label__m _U  Do  they  not  do  the  super  co-codamol  or  tramadol  etc  where  you  are?
__label__m _U  _U  Remember  when  your  mom  gave  you  a  cookie..instead  of  the  Valium  you  really  wanted?
__label__m _U  Hmm  I’m  not  sure,  I  feel  like  the  dog  would  be  too  easy  and  predictable,  what  happen  to  rasmus  as  well  at  the  end,  there’s  something  they’re  hiding,  I  really  think  she  commit  suicide  because  she  was  afraid,  I  feel  like  the  morphine  mutated  the  cure  in  rasmus  as  well
__label__m I  have  read  &  watched  so  much  deeply  relaxing  Brit  crime  fiction  at  this  point  that  just  hearing  the  word  "vicarage"  is  like  klonopin.
__label__m _U  Oh  god!    Poor  him.    I  was  offered  badass  stuff  2  years  ago  n  turned  it  down.  Begged  for  diazepam  last  year  n  was  not  given  it
__label__c i  have  to  take  my  vyvanse  for  the  whole  weekend  before  i  can  talk  to  my  doctor  about  the  compulsive  lip  biting  and  foot  shaking  😧
__label__m Now  cos  of  this  whole  drug  abuse  issue  when  i  see  a  bunch  of  thug  looking  young  men  sitting  with  a  reporter  with  mic  in  hand  i  automatically  assume  they  are  discussing  tramadol  lolxx
__label__m _U  also  sorry  to  hear  about  that.  a  dude  that  used  to  work  with  me  overdosed  on  oxycontin  a  few  years  back.  i  know  the  feeling.
__label__m xanax  are  bad  for  you
__label__c nothing  is  working  for  this  panic  attack!  taking  me  off  of  klonopin  wasn't  medically  necessary.  it  was  just  cruel!  #patientsnotaddicts
__label__m _U  who  popped  a  valium  in  _U  ?  #liar
__label__u _U  Wanna  be?  U  should  watch  all  his  vids...i  member  learning  morphine  from  him
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Erin  go  choke  on  some  adderall.  fuck  off
__label__m _U  sounds  like  all  you  need  is  a  valium  hon,  not  for  me  to  be  penalized  by  the  irs.
__label__m Did  someone  say  “aerosol  Ativan”?
__label__m i  was  stuck  with  300  junior  high  kids  for  2  and  half  hours  last  night,  there's  not  enough  xanax  in  the  world  for  that  shit...
__label__a unsure  why  they  don't  prescribe  oxycodone  to  stop  smoking,  i've  barely  smoked  at  all  since  surgery.  now  which  7-11  do  i  get  a  pack  of  oxy  at
__label__a Just  watched  a  documentary  on  the  dangers  of  taking  Adderall.  Honestly  just  makes  me  want  to  take  it  more  in  order  to  get  through  this  last  semester  🤔
__label__m “_U:  why  is  adderall  so  expensive!?!?”  😂😂😂😂😂😂
__label__m _U  nothing  special,  just  us.  but  that  sucks.  they  didn't  give  you  morphine  or  anything?
__label__m _U  Milk  or  Xanax
__label__c _U  i  should  remember!  sold  a  print  to  someone  in  hongkong  and  that's  how  he  paid  me.  :)  thank  you  neurontin  no  memory  is  fun  😐
__label__m #pope:  jesus  said  we  need  to  pick  up  our  cross  and  follow  him,  he  didn't  say  to  take  morphine  to  sleep  well!  being  welcoming  is  a  cross.
__label__m I  was  seriously  obsessed  with  this  play  when  I  was  in  high  school,  and  always  loved  Mary  Tyrone's  descent  into  full  morphine  ghost.
__label__m Lets  play  a  game  called  how  many  xanax  can  al  eat  before  he  doesnt  wake  up
__label__c being  on  vyvanse  has  me  functioning  at  another  level.
__label__u _U  Avar  nursenu  sollikittu  Ulla  vandha  Nadigai...  Nursekana  endha  Valium  theriyala  basic  first  aid  kuda  theriyathu...  Poli
__label__c I  always  talk  myself  out  of  taking  my  Vyvanse  and  then  when  I  take  it  I  kick  myself  for  not  taking  it  other  days.
__label__a _U  as  you  can  see,  there's  a  dent  next  to  my  face  from  crushing  adderall
__label__m "both  theanine  and  alprazolam  failed  to  significantly  reduce  anxiety  symptoms  in  the  model  of  anticipatory  anxiety."
__label__m #mynursejusttoldme  morphine  use  is  great  at  first  but  ends  leaving  you  disappointed  and  empty  just  like  the  avengers  movie  franchise
__label__m It's  you,  beb.  And  I'm  a  sucker  for  the  way  that  you  move,  beb.  And  I  could  try  to  run,  but  it  would  be  useless.  You're  to  blame  Just  one  hit  of  you,  I  knew  I'll  never  be  the  same.  It's  you,  beb.    Nicotine??  Heroin??  Morphine??  No,  no,  nooo...  beb.  Just  'tuna  bakar',  just  it.
__label__a some  one  PLEASE  buy  adderall  off  me  😩😩😩
__label__m cute  date  idea:    both  of  us  overdose  off  oxycontin
__label__m adderall  just  slaying
__label__m get  your  oxycodone  ready  kids,  here  comes  trevor  rosenthal!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  could  be  recovering?  methadone  program?
__label__a i  really  miss  xanax  me...  it's  like  i  had  more  friends  then  cause  most  of  y'all  just  wanted  my  bars,  especially  the  hoes.
__label__m "Some  junkie  rapper  named  Lil  Peep  overdosed  on  Xanax  and  became  Lil  Sleep"  weakkkk
__label__m _U      #morphine  #Horologium
__label__m _U  the  donald  on  valium  using  teleprompters.  sounds  as  empty  as  he  is.
__label__m UK  heroin  &  morphine  deaths  have  doubled  in  5  years.  It  works  out  a  death  every  5  hours.    So  much  tragedy.  Feel  for  addicts  &  their  families
__label__m _U  Of  1  tooth  trailer  park  dwellers  on  Oxycontin
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  i  take  neurontin  too!  tons  of  it!
__label__c _U  I  saw  "liquid  Xanax"  and  was  all  over  it.    It's  not  that  extreme  but  it  def  makes  you  feel  relaxed.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Totally  agree,  but  some  patients  with  chronic  pain  conditions  need  a  higher  dose.  That  dose  can’t  be  given  with  a  safe  dose  of  oxycodone  and  you  need  a  stronger  opioid.
__label__c getting  ativan  stuck  in  yr  windpipe  is  not  fun  do  not  recommend
__label__c wouldn't  be  functioning  without  vyvanse  right  now
__label__c _U  what's  ed-nos  ?  and  i  used  to  take  seroquel  it's  entirely  too  strong  to  take  on  a  daily  basis
__label__m i  found  someones  discarded  methadone  perscription,  googled  their  name  and  have  been  reading  about  their  crimes  online  for  the  last  hour.
__label__m perpetually  four  five  seconds  from  wildin'.      that's  what  xanax  is  for.
__label__a _U  _U  :sorry  my  pain  med  blurred  my  vision  just  took  another  oxycodone  with  coffee  great  breakfast#patientsnotaddicts
__label__m Too  funny  working  in  a  chemist  giving  jakies  methadone  for  8  hours
__label__m neeeeeeeeeeeeeeed  xanax
__label__m I  had  a  dream  that  I  took  Xanax  and  I  could  fly  and  was  flying  through  my  neighbors  yards  and  then  they  all  started  a  group  chat  talkin  shit
__label__m Soo...basically  to  be  a  rapper  nowadays  you  need  to  have  bad  dreads,  terrible  face  tattoos,  put  “lil”  in  front  of  your  name,  and  talk  about  how  much  Xanax  you  pop  daily.  Gotcha.
__label__m my  dad  fr  asked  me  if  we  had  any  xanax  b/c  he  saw  my  little  sister  talking  to  a  guy  in  our  front  yard
__label__c the  universe  ain’t  ready  for  me  to  die  apparently,  cuz  i  can  never  find  xanax  when  i  think  i  need  it
__label__c i  was  in  so  much  debt  and  stress  from  school  my  body  said  you  need  ativan  and  your  body  handles  the  stress  like  that  of  a  two  year  old!
__label__c _U  _U  Lyrica  and  I  really  didn't  get  along.  It  was  like  it  turned  my  brain  off,  and  then  the  allergic  reaction  kicked  in.  Bad  stuff.
__label__c They  told  me  25%  reduction  in  their  prescription  of  opioids  DEA  driven    (but  willing  to  give  me  same    MG  in  ER  form  OXYCONTIN  AND  15  percs  for  breakthrough.  Maybe  their  goal  is  to  limit  amount  of  pills?  I’m  scared  to  ask  I’m  scared  of  being  non  compliant  and  being  pushed  off.
__label__m Just  like  nicomaine,  heroin,  morphine  Suddenly,  I'm  a  fiend  and  you're  all  I  need  All  I  need,  yeah,  you're  all  I  need
__label__m just  hook  my  veins  up  to  morphine  already
__label__m ‘Do  you  and  can  you  take  morphine  on  a  night  out’  Chester  uni  for  ya
__label__m _U  klonopin,  ativan,  benzos  in  general  i  find  neuroprotective.  gabapentin  sometimes,  head  in  cold  water  for  vagus  stim
__label__a bottle  of  seroquel  is  looking  very  good  rn
__label__c i  just  want  to  bawl  my  eyes  out,  but  crying  makes  it  worse.  i  kind  of  want  to  go  to  the  ER.  i  had  to  take  2  tramadol  @  once  today.
__label__c taking  lorazepam  and  I  am  now  extremely  affectionate
__label__m _U  ramona  told  andy  on  wwl  that  sonja  mixes  alcohol  with  tranquilizers.  who  uses  that  word  for  xanax  these  days.?  hilarious.
__label__m pj's  in  public  craze  is  sweeping  westward.  hopefully  without  all  the  oxycodone  that  inspired  the  first  wave  of  this  fashion  trend.
__label__m _U  I’m  from  there.  My  parents  still  live  there.  It’s  a  funny  old  place-  worked  in  chemist.  On  1  side  I  was  giving  people  their  methadone  prescription,  on  the  other  side  I  was  dealing  with  the  cameras  &  films  of  some  very  wealthy  (&  often  quite  rude)  people.  (This  was  in  90s)
__label__c one  of  the  hardest  decisions  i  make  each  and  every  day  of  this  miserable  life  is  taking  xanax  or  zzzquil  before  bed
__label__m thank  based  god  for  adderall
__label__m oxycontin  organ  0  back  celestial  thing  die  flip  to
__label__m hey  creeper...  i  suggest  u    have  your  zyprexa  dosage,  adjusted.  you  are  clearly  unwell.  #impairedthoughtprocesses  #ineffectivecoping
__label__m _U  maybe  make  sure  guests  like  _U  are  fully  dosed  up  on  their  lorazepam  before  they  give  an  interview,  ya  know?
__label__a xanax  and  patron,  how  the  fuck  am  i  gettin  home
__label__m _U  _U  Valium  makes  you  feel  very  happy.
__label__m a  few  of  you  need  to  pop  some  xanax
__label__a My  insomnia  is  getting  out  of  hand.  I'm  sick  and  tired  all  the  time.  Xanax,  Zopiclone  &  vodka.  I  still  can't  sleep.  I  hope  one  day  I'll  fall  asleep  and  not  wake  up.  I'm  sick  of  being  sick.
__label__a _U  😂  I'll  come  thru  soon  and  deliver  your  morphine
__label__m _U  _U  take  a  valium  or  6

__label__a Ad  sex  I'm  on  xanax.
__label__a _U  yeah,  i've  been  goin  out  with  a  few  friends  into  that  tech  house  underground  scene  and  it's  coke  and  adderall  and  oxy  everywhere
__label__c i  don't  think  the  morphine  is  working  for  me  at  all.......fucking  insurance  co  should  have  let  me  have  the  oxycontin
__label__m That's  what  happens  when  u  come  off  a  drug  1.5*  stronger  than  morphine    Tramadol,  by  comparison  is  10%  of  the  strength  of  morphine,  so  about  6%  as  strong  as  Oxycontin    Of  course  they  will  need  a  high  dose,  you  are  used  to  medication  15*  more  powerful
__label__c _U  I’m  on  Venlafaxine  and  Quetiapine  xxxx
__label__c Great.  I  guess  I'm  gonna  be  on  klonopin  and  prozac  now.
__label__m money  is  like  a  packet  of  seeds  performing  for  Valium
__label__a i  think  my  game  plan  is  to  pop  a  adderall  3  hours  before  my  final  and  hope  i  learn  all  the  coding  i  need  to  for  my  final
__label__a “_U:  adderall  or  vyvanse,  where  u  at?”  i  gotchu  hmu
__label__m _U  What  about  if  he  takes  Tramadol,  Codeine  and  Coke..that  shouldn’t  be  a  problem👀
__label__u _U  Did  he  fuck  lyrica?  I  have  so  many  questions.
__label__m what  does  xanax  do  &  what  is  it  for  ??  i'm  not  a  crackhead  so  i  wouldn't  know.  nevertheless,  ryan  looked  pretty  fucked  up.  #teenmomog
__label__u i'm  lyrica  mom  look  like  a  blow  up  doll  on  wet  😧  and  this  nigga  look  like  he  was  in  the  cat  daddy  video  😐
__label__c krazy  how  i  took  a  oxycodone  from  my  dresser  .  i  feel  like  i'm  in  the  clouds  .
__label__m _U  _U  Did  anyone  actually  read  the  pamphlet  before  commenting?  It  clearly  states  that  NA  considers  people  that  are  on  methadone  or  buprenorphine  for  OUD  treatment  to  be  “using,”  and  should  be  discouraged  from  sharing  at  meetings,  chairing,  or  taking  a  service  position.

__label__m v  jealous  of  what  a  good  time  my  cat  is  having  on  buprenorphine
__label__c Had  a  panic  attack  at  midnight.  Utterly  bizarre  experience  that  came  out  of  nowhere  and  felt  like  being  plugged  into  the  mains.  Popped  a  couple  of  valium  and  gone  to  bed.  Huge  sympathies  to  any  regular  sufferers.
__label__c My  favorite  drink  is  methadone      Bitter  and  fruity..  mmmmmm
__label__m _U  _U  _U  The  pharmacokinetics  of  diazepam  are  misunderstood.  It  has  a  short  duration  of  action  when  initially  administered  because  it  is  lipophilic  and  taken  up  in  tissue  (muscle  and  fat).  It  only  has  a  long  elimination  half  life  because  it  is  released  slowly  from  the  tissue.

__label__c day  two  of  different  meds  and  i’ve  determined  that  while  the  fatigue  is  still  present  the  focalin  definitely  suppresses  it  all  day  vs  the  adderall  which  would  exacerbate  it.
__label__m _U  _U  Says  the  guy  who  started  the  conversation  by  calling  me  a  Dunce.  Ovaltine  won’t  do.  Bert  needs  diazepam  😂😂

__label__c _U  i  remember  getting  kaoline  and  morphine  cough  medicine  as  a  child  and  young  adult  -  slept  like  a  baby  feeling  quite  fine!
__label__c Also,  yes,  Abilify  did  not  work  out  because  it  caused  a  whole  sleu  of  bad  physical  problems  in  the  course  of  2  weeks.  No  thank  you!  :/
__label__c unfortunately  pregabalin  makes  me  sane  and  stops  my  brain  from  falling  out  of  my  skull  so  i  have  to  cope  with  forgetting  all  the  cool  words  i  know  right  when  i  need  them
__label__m _U  "  cure  used  by  psychiatrists  is  to  prescribe  drugs  such  as  diazepam  to  correct  the  imbalance  in  the  body"  wow  diazepam  corrects  serotonin  syndrome  -  _U  you  are  an  embarrassment
__label__c _U  All  I  can  tell  you  is  that  for  myself,  I  watch  every  episode  live.  I've  never  missed  an  episode.  I  have  to  tell  you  this  one  thing.  15  years  ago  I  was  in  the  hospital  with  a  serious  illness.  They  gave  me  morphine.  Good  stuff.
__label__m Review  of  olanzapine:  addictive  tablets  overall,  definitely  a  strong  setative.

__label__c Have  you  done  laser  or  electro?  If  you  have  hypersensitive  nerves  prepare  for  hell.  Upper  lip  electro  SUCKS!  Even  with  numbing  cream  I  can  only  manage  15  minutes.  That  shit  leaves  me  in  tears.  I  had  electro  yesterday  and  used  numbing  cream,  percocet,  valium  and  MJ.  It  still  hurt.
__label__m Now  testifying  is  Paula  Peterson.  Her  sons  have  battled  addiction  and  resort  to  buying  suboxone  on  the  street  to  treat  heroin  addictions.  “This  is  a  family  disease  and  we  all  need  to  recover.  It  is  our  friends  and  our  families.”  Access  to  treatment  and  stopping  stigma  top  of  mind

He  just  looks  like  a  small  old  confederate  colonel  with  residual  white  supremacist  beliefs.  #badasyouthink
__label__m Is  hazel  on  tramadol  #ThisMorning  #shit  story
__label__m Just  shut  the  fuck  up  and  gimme  valium
__label__m _U  Xanax  came  to  my  mind.
__label__m birds  in  the  trap  sing  brian  mcknight,  percocet  and  codeine  please  don't  take  my  liifeee
__label__u y’all  know  why  lyrica  and  ginny  are  so  good  at  what  they  do  right.......they  literally  have  ariela  to  give  them  pointers
__label__c Feeling  hungry  when  have  taken  Adderall  is  such  a  weird  hungry.  You  only  feel  your  stomach  growling  not  really  hunger.  I  could  lose  so  much  weight!  Lol.
__label__c good  thing  i  took  some  ativan  it's  really  helping  with  the  ocd...  mmmm  or  def  not.  ?  i'm  tots  finucci
__label__m _U  Iran  right  here  in  Chicago.  Maybe  they  should  put  some  Xanax  in  the  water  supply.
__label__m _U  _U  making  your  voice  an  auditory  version  of  xanax  may  help.
__label__a selling  suboxone  at  rehab
__label__m when  people  try  and  tell  me  that  aleve  and  advil  are  the  same  thing  ...  yeah  the  same  way  tylenol  and  morphine  are  the  same  but  not  really
__label__m How  many  people  will  have  their  lives  destroyed  by  the  corrupt  institution  of  psychiatry  today?  #zyprexa  #prescribedharm
__label__m xanax  isn't  cool  man
__label__m So  because  you  don’t  have  the  Percocet  that  Future  and  Migos  rap  about  you  want  to  abuse  Tramadol  and  Benylin?  Beloved,  please  don’t  do  it  for  the  culture
__label__m _U  Hydrocodone  And  Ibuprofen  800mg  Solves  A  Lot  Problems!  Love  YOU  More  Than  Love
__label__m _U  Klonopin  or  some  longer  lasting  benzo  might  work.
__label__m comey  is  so  unflappable  it's  unbelievable.  i  would  need  my  shrink  holding  my  hand  and  an  ativan  drip.
__label__m _U  _U  saying  "did  ya  just  pick  up  your  methadone  Benny?".    His  dad  had  to  check  for  damage  and  photograph  the  accident  as  the  homeless  bums  still  drunk  and  awake  from  the  night  before  trashed  his  son  😂
__label__a just  realized  i  dented  my  phone  from  trying  to  crush  a  xanax  over  a  month  ago  :-(
__label__c i've  been  offered  hydrocodone  for  a  mild  headache,  &  tylenol  w/a  narcotic  for  an  inflamed  painful-to-touch  forearm.  1/x
__label__a On  the  plus  side,  I  found  TEN  Tramadol  in  an  old  handbag  I  was  clearing  out  to  take.  TEN!  Unimagined  painkiller  riches!
__label__m OPIOIDS:  OXYCODONE  -  Common  brand  names:  Oxycontin,  Roxicodone,  Percodan,  Percocet.    HYDROCODONE  -  sold  under  the  brand  names:  Vicodin,  Lortab,  Norco.
__label__a Diazepam  &  wine  sounds  like  a  wonderful  idea  rn  like  why  wouldn’t  I
__label__a adderall  delivered  to  at  infusion  while  i'm  studying  🙌
__label__c _U  Can  you  please  explain  that  I  don't  just  do  Xanax  for  fun  and  that  I  have  to  take  it  in  order  to  not  panic  in  car  rides  😂😂
__label__c i  was  prescribed  oxycodone  for  my  tonsil  pain,  but  even  opiates  can't  soothe  the  pain  of  watching  the  _U  play  football.
__label__c I’m  on  my  own  sobriety  journey  rn,  6  months  clean  from  heroin  but  still  on  methadone  so  some  ppl  don’t  consider  that  sober  which  feels  bad.  It’s  rly  rly  hard  and  sobriety  isn’t  as  black  and  white  as  being  sober  or  not.  It’s  rly  personal  and  part  of  getting  sober  is  relapsing  it
__label__a damn  brain  working  well  during  midnight  just  when  i'm  supposed  to  sleep.  valium  please  hahaha
__label__a i  will  give  anyone  an  adderall  if  they  help  me  get  my  homework  done  before  tomorrow.
__label__u Lyrica  is  just  so  fucking  annoying  tbh  loved  her  last  season  nows  shes  a  beg
__label__m _U  _U  They  do  abuse  it,  it  gets/keeps  ppl  "high,"  the  quantity  I've  heard  some  ppl  get  is  crazy!  I  also  know  some  sell  their  Suboxone  for  other  drugs.  It  is  the  4th  most  diverted  drug  on  the  street.  So  where  does  any  of  this  make  sense?
__label__a I  used  to  sell  OxyContin  in  trailer  parks  now  all  these  designers  and  boutique  owners  in  LA  tellin  me  I’m  up  next.
__label__m _U  Xanax  is  one  of  the  most  addictive  benzodiazepine  medications  on  the  market.  I  honesty  cannot  imagine  any  sane  human  would  defend  taking  it  on  a  regular  basis.  It's  a  nasty,  nasty  drug.
__label__c As  someone  deeply  frightened  by  bridges  and  tunnels  it  probably  would’ve  behooved  me  to  take  a  Xanax  before  going  through  the  goddamn  Chesapeake  Bay  Bridge  system  but  here  I  am  a  few  miles  away  and  freaking  out
__label__a _U  if  its  fox  news  (and  of  course  it  is!)  it  usually  takes  1  dose  of  ritalin+1  dose  of  my  xanax  to  zonk  my  grandkids  out  enough
__label__m _U  i  am  imagining  that  includes  a  schlar  family  who  pushed/owned  Oxycontin...
__label__c yes  very  rt  _U:  serious  question  :  does  oxycodone  make  anybody  else  slpy?
__label__u I'm  over  this  orange  flame  Lyrica  got  on  her  head.
__label__m my  homie  laid  down  a  cold  hard  definition  of  xanax  a  couple  days  ago.    "the  drug  that  renders  your  brain  useless"
__label__a yeah  baby  i  love  prom  anyone  got  any  heroin  or  xanax  i  can  have  for  prom?
__label__m I'm  fucked.  Good  day  to  you  all.  Pass  the  Valium.
__label__m pop  a  xanax  forget  the  world  🤤
__label__c Just  woke  up  from  my  Tramadol  +  Tylenol-induced  nap.  What’d  I  miss?
__label__m If  methadone  is  free  to  addicts  because  they  have  a  disease  then  why  is  chemo  not  free  for  camper  patients!😶
__label__m _U  i  swear  i  need  a  xanax  to  calm  me  down...  😳
__label__m overheard...  "what  does  it  say  about  me  as  a  person  that  adderall  takes  the  edge  off?"  #troublesintribeca
__label__m maybe  it's  time  to  get  some  adderall  lol
__label__m I  want  lorazepam  adderall  and  love
__label__m _U  we  are  trying  to  find  out.  we  believe  it  was  the  diazepam  injection  tool
__label__a _U  I'm  bored.  So  i  just  took  4  mg  klonopin
__label__a _U  I'm  developing  an  unhealthy  addiction  to  Ativan,  because  this  apartment  thing  is  stressing  me  out.
__label__a _U  Look  I  Will  Tell  You  Xanax  While  I  Drank  To  Pass  The  Time
__label__c 20+  years  with  debilitating,  painful  autoimmune  diseases.    morphine  patches  and  hydrocodone  i  can  get,  but  not  #medicalmarijuana  in  texas!
__label__a i  wish  someone  would  shove  vyvanse  down  my  throat
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  vero  would  morphine  cause  any  of  these
__label__m _U  _U  and  _U  all  in  one  night?  my  _U  notifications  are  on  adderall  right  now
__label__a just  took  a  xanax  again  im  the  man
__label__m _U  _U  Since  when  it  was  made  from  morphine...  a  opioid  poppy
__label__m 7  Clonazepam
__label__c Ugh.  I  forgot  momentarily  that  I  needed  to  stay  up  for  _U  new  album    release  and  took  a  Xanax!  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  #FreedomChild
__label__m _U  _U  Sounds  like  he  takes  a  valium  before  he  reads  and  doesn’t  seem  to  even  understand  what  he  is  reading
__label__m Alcohol  &  drugs  1980  I  asked  two  alcohol  specialists  why  drug  addicts  were  prescribed  methadone  long  term,  and  alkies  only  got  ten  day  detox
__label__m Could  be  in  out  patient  treatment.  Some  Dr's  use  Suboxone  as  a  methadone-type  drug  to  help  with  withdrawls  and  cravings  from  opiates.  It  also  contains  Naloxone  which  prohibits  shooting  up  and  is  an  opiate  antagonist.If  you  do  heroin/pills  you  wont  get  high.  Sell  ur  scrip-  to  jail
__label__m _U  just  take  an  adderall  the  next  day  don't  be  lame!!!
__label__c _U  Was  grateful  for  morphine  after  ops,  had  my  entire  life  scarred  by  alcoholic  parent  (  who  I  loved  dearly,  but  she  was  addicted  to  it)  of  the  two?  Alcohol  so  much  more  accessible  and  harmful.
__label__c Goin  30  off  the  Alprazolam
__label__m i'm  convinced  everyone  takes  adderall  except  me..  but  i  never  would  because  i  don't  do  meth
__label__c dropped  my  adderall  prescription  off,  can't  be  filled  until  tomorrow  morning  :'(
__label__m _U  profile  not  too  dissimilar  from  quetiapine
__label__m 50  mg  of  Hydroxyzine  and  100mg  of  Tramadol,  taken  in  front  of  him  and  verbally  disclosed  to  him.    What  consent?  #MeToo
__label__c im  supposed  to  take  my  new  vyvanse  'only  on  the  morrow  ever'  but  guess  who  cant  read  suddenly
__label__m Valium  and  UFOs
__label__m "_U:  anybody  can  fuck  with  me  on  some  adderall  let  me  know"  imma  lob  this  to  my  tl...
__label__c adderall  got  me  getting  ready  to  get  ready...  to  get  ready.
__label__m _U  Got  pain?  Take  Oxycodone/Vicodin  Got  Opioid  induced  constipation?  Take  Movantik
__label__m i  can  almost  smell  the  adderall  seeping  out  of  everyone's  pores  at  the  library.
__label__m wow  this  whole  time  when  people  referenced  the  "holy  trinity"  i  thought  they  were  talking  about  prozac,  xanax,  and  adderall
__label__m "in  adderall  we  trust"
__label__a Mouth  dry  as  the  desert  after  copious  amounts  of  Grey  Goose  then  a  pregabalin  last  night.  Praise  jebus  for  the  pregab  though!
__label__m just  some  xanax  bars  and  some  apathy.
__label__c _U  truuuuuuth.  getting  back  on  adderall  has  made  me  productive  again.
__label__m totally  irrelevant  but  xanax  is  basically  pez  candy.  pain  pills  &  e  was  all  phs  had  yet  nobody  lost  a  finger
__label__m i  feel  like  i  just  snorted  a  ton  of  adderall  but  really  i  just  drank  my  preworkout.
__label__m Diazepam,  come  back  as  a  Steve.
__label__m I  would  be  such  a  good  nail  tech  if  I  had  an  adderall  script

__label__m ._U  does  that  trent  richardson  1st  round  bust  trade  give  you  more  ulcers  than  the  habitual  oxycodone  abuse?
__label__a adderall  is  much  needed  for  ou  this  weekend
__label__c Pro  tip:  Don't  pluck  your  eyebrows  right  after  you  take  your  Adderall  or  there  will  be  hell  to  pay.  #lifehack
__label__m my  brother  outdid  himself  at  the  gym  yesterday  and  he's  complaining  about  his  body  hurting  so  he  took  oxycontin  for  it  😂😂😂😭  #same
__label__c Adderall  keep  me  from  going  to  sleep...
__label__m "i  had  to  take  a  xanax  because  my  back  was  hurting."  lmao  wat.
__label__c idk  how  people  think  vyvanse  better  than  adderall  u  gotta  be  dumb  af  to  think  that.
__label__m "I  need  a  full  Xanax  rn,  cuz  I'm  just  not"  overheard  on  the  tram
__label__a _U  Some  days  are  better  than  others  but  Ativan  and  thc  get  me  by  most  times.
__label__m defendant  greets  the  bench  with  a  cheery  "hello!".  he  is  late  arriving  at  court  because  he  was  collecting  his  methadone  script.  #swansmags
__label__m Vera  ended  up  getting  angry  at  the  Alderson  family  that  he  wanted  revenge  on  them  and  has  been  planning  for  a  long  time.  And  unbeknownst  to  Shayla,  he  was  just  using  her  to  get  to  Elliot  bc  he  knew  he  had  a  drug  problem  and  needed  Suboxone.
__label__c Maria  and  I  have  my  adderall  scrip  again  thank  fucking  god  i'm  so  ready  to  start  actually  getting  shit  done  again

__label__m _U  mika  needs  a  dose  of  adderall  b4  the  pop  culture  segment.  she  thinks  shrieking  &  bouncing  &  contorting  covers  up  her  ineptitude
__label__c Excuses,  excuses,  excuses.  I  am  67  yrs  old  and  on  a  full  dose  of  Ambien.  Ambien  may  make  you  do  some  crazy  things  but  tweeting  hate  ain’t  one  of  them.  You  should  be  on  a  half  dosage  at  your  age...or  maybe  none  at  all...see  your  doctor  I  think  you  may  need  to  switch  to  clonazepam.
__label__a when  am  i  not  gonna  go  to  school  fucked  up  on  adderall  lol  smh
__label__a I  can’t  even  describe  how  frustrated  and  angry  I  constantly  am  at  _U  .  Even  making  a  god  damn  ONE  TIME  PAYMENT  TAKES  10  STEPS.  Someone  get  me  a  Xanax  today.
__label__m _U  he  singing  about  xanax  and  adderall  for  33  minutes  though.  it's  cool  though.
__label__a haha  i  just  wanna  pop  12  xanax  and  die  rn
__label__m _U  Hands  down.  Or  a  double  dose  of  benzo  or  valium.
__label__c the  struggle  is  rough.  and  i  don't  have  any  adderall
__label__m _U  adderall  is  a  drug  that  helps  you  focus  better
__label__m _U  Always  give  in  if  threatened  but  once  you  feel  manipulated  -which  is  usually  seen  when  you  emotionally  respond  to  a  request  for  opioids  emotional  (tears/anger/fear  ect)-say  NO-working  in  a  methadone  prescribing  practice  trained  the  hairs  on  your  neck  to  have  high  specificity
__label__m *This  original  blog  post  claimed  that  Suboxone  was  originally  approved  as  a  detox  medication.  Upon  further  research,  it  seems  that  claim  was  inaccurate.  The  original  FDA  approval  was  for  the  treatment  of  opiate  dependence..."    So  that  is  why  everyone  is  now  opioid  dependent!😡😡
__label__m subtle  sabotage:  replacing  your  archenemy's  adderall  supply  with  melatonin--sweet  dreams,  prick
__label__a _U  Yesterday  I  combined  Clonazepam  and  alcohol  (probably  a  bad  idea)  then  slept  it  off  and  went  out  and  bought  a  book  (a  slightly  better  idea).  Today  I  may  go  see  Ocean's  8,  if  I  can  justify  spending  my  last  twenty  bucks  or  so  on  the  movies.
__label__m adderall  or  xanax
__label__m lmaoooo  rt  _U:  when  the  xanax  hits  for  a  white  person  =  when  the  beat  drops  for  a  black  person.

__label__c thank  you  google  for  stopping  me  from  taking  oxy  and  xanax  together
__label__m Wholly  irresponsible  journalism  by  _U,  as  AP  McCoy  entices  a  generation  to  be  thrown  off  a  bloody  great  horse  at  speed,  break  umpteen  bones  and  then  get  stoned  on  morphine.  And,  while  I’m  here,  can  anyone  find  me  an  angry  racehorse?  No  reason...
__label__c _U  I  use  to  be  prescribed  Tramadol  -  I  was  prescribed  120  at  a  time!  (1  month)

__label__c i  love  how  everyone  assumes  i'm  always  good.  when  in  reality  my  life  is  a  mess  &  the  only  thing  keeping  me  together  is  xanax  and  sleep.
__label__c _U  _U  holy  cow!!  substitute  xanax  for  2  vicodin  n  we  are  having  the  same  kinda  night
__label__a _U  enzo  has  to  be  the  one  selling  everyone  adderall

__label__c _U  Knee  surgery.  Keyhole.  On  the  morphine  for  now
__label__m _U  so  does  rush  limbaugh.  unless  he's  being  investigated  for  doctor  shopping  so  he  can  get  prescribed  oxycodone

__label__m it  makes  me  uncomfortable  knowing  that  people  take  xanax  for  guilty  pleasures
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Wrong--see  my  tweet  above.    People  get  delirious/blackout  on  Ativan  all  the  time,  plus  butalbital  is  a  barbiturate.    They  are  synergistic,  so  even  greater  risk  of  uncontrolled  out  of  character  behavior  exactly  like  extreme  drunkenness  causes.    Psychiatrist  here.
__label__m if  you  ever  leave  me  baby,  leave  some  morphine  at  my  door  cause  it  will  take  a  whole  load  of  medication,  to  realize  what  we  used  to  have  we  don't  have  it  anymore

__label__m i  hope  all  my  friends  that  do  xanax  with  a  16  year  old  have  more  fun  than  me  staying  in  bed  reading  books  and  drawing  #sarcasm
__label__m Around  this  time,  Gia  enrolled  in  an  methadone  program  but  soon  began  using  heroin  again.  Carangi's  final  photo  shoot  was  for  German  mail-order  clothing  company  Otto  Versand  in  Tunisia;  she  was  sent  home  during  the  shoot  for  using  heroin.
__label__m _U  Sure,  let  me  go  invest  all  my  money  in  hydrocodone  first
__label__m if  you  mix  beer  with  valium,  will  you  die  or  will  you  die?
__label__m _U  you'll  realize  how  xanax  makes  a  lot  of  people  look  like  crackheads  lbs
__label__a _U  _U  _U  i'll  send  you  up  some  diclofenac  or  tramadol  as  an  alternative  if  you  need  it.
__label__c _U  my  hands  are  always  hot  on  adderall
__label__c _U  _U  Could  not  sleep  on  seroquel  here.        I  guess  you  can  say  I  had  a  bad  reaction.
__label__m _U  Even  in  this  country  tramadol  is  perscription  only,  very  silly  lady.
__label__a life  gets  so  rough  when  the  adderall  and  drunk  wears  off  🙄
__label__m _U  i  think  anyone's  who's  had  to  endure  ativan  steven  knows  that.  mostly  women  but.
__label__c _U  I've  heard  it's  a  thing  people  do.  I  used  to  do  it  easily,  but  Adderall  has  totally  killed  my  appetite
__label__c adderall  &  anxiety  medicine:  i  need  to  get  everything  done  but  i'm  also  not  worried  about  it  idk
__label__m _U  That’s  a  picture  of  adderall,  which  is  NOT  free
__label__m lmao  i  need  an  ativan
__label__m EU  TO  MUITO  VICIADA  EM  LORAZEPAM,  E  FAZ  TIPO,  DOIS  MESES  QUE  TO  TOMANDO,  ALGUÉM  ME  AJUDA
__label__a i  have  8  xanax  left.  they're  the  blue,  1mg.  i'm  selling  then  for  only  $2,  so  hmu
__label__m It’s  so  funny  how  republicans  blame  drug  cartels,  immigrant  for  the  drug  issue  and  focus  on  “protecting  the  border”  when  the  literal  reason  we  have  a  fentanyl/opioid  epidemic  is  from  the  over  prescription  of  legal  heroine  OxyContin.  It’s  really  cute.
__label__m “_U:  _U  _U  adderall  makes  you  concentrated  af  if  that  makes  sense”oh  😂
__label__m _U  hope  it  gets  better,  i  remember  when  my  dad  was  on  morphine  in  hospital  cause  he  fell  down  the  stairs  on  christmas  day
__label__m To  keep  this  environment  warm  which  we  believe  may  be  UNSAFE    LIVE  in  after  Rebecca  coupe  PROSTITUTING  METHADONE  ADDICTED  criminal  TRASHED  as  non  of  the  DOORS  AND  WINDOWS  FIT  OR  CLOSE  PROPERLY  ln  this  WETHER  4  a  DISABLED  mom  who  as  Nealy  DIED  is  hard  and  costly  but  u  don't  care!
__label__m If  you  are  going  to  have  Jackie  on  then  give  her  a  couple  of  Xanax  before  the  show!  #qanda
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  adderall  czar
__label__u I  want  to  set  Morphine  for  Chrome  so  that  it’ll  let  me  watch  Netflix  for  30  minutes  if  I  reply  to  emails  for  5  minutes  but  it  won’t  let  me.
__label__c I  think  my  abilify  is  why  I'm  gaining  so  mich  weight
__label__a i  need  some  adderall  to  redo  all  my  sports  notifications.  anyone  recommend  a  good  pl  app?
__label__m The  gaming  industry  and    while  hitting  the  nae  nae  listening  to  xanax  ,such  a  prankster
__label__m hydrocodone  on  the  hands-free  phone.
__label__m _U  i've  tried  everything  to  get  him  help.    he  just  started  a  suboxone  program  so  hopefully  this  will  help  a  little
__label__m She  bruises  coughs  she  splutters  pistol  shots  But  hold  her  down  with  soggy  clothes  and  breezeblocks  She’s  morphine  queen  of  my  vaccine  my  love  my  love  love  love,  la  la  la  la  🎶
__label__c i'm  actually  nervous  for  tuesday,  i  might  have  to  take  a  xanax  on  the  low
__label__m _U  Morphine  has  John  McCain  tuned-up!
__label__m _U  It's  called  methadone.  Although  I'm  not  sure  it  will  work  in  this  case.
__label__m If  it’s  not  too  late  can  someone  give  #xanto  a  couple  of  Xanax  so  it  can  calm  down  a  bit  before  tomorrow?
__label__m A  Xanax  commercial  but  it's  me  trying  to  remember  if  I've  tweeted  my  Groundhog  Day  tweet  every  day.
__label__c _U  Its  awful  Mags!!  Yes.  Morphine.  Gives  me  hardly  any  relief  x
__label__c _U  Oh  no  I  wasn't  good  on  Gabapentin  either  and  I  seem  to  be  on  the  rest  of  the  meds  you're  on
__label__m _U  i  knew  what  you  meant.  it's  quite  hard  to  work  out  what's  going  on  under  the  influence  of  quetiapine  ha  ha
__label__m why  ppl  say  i  need  a  xanax  😂
__label__m _U  😭😭😭😭😭  no  OxyContin  ,  no  boys  who  don't  know  what  phat  farms  are
__label__m _U  _U  Yep  but  that’s  the  problem  when  _U  fails  it’s  huge  and  they  don’t  follow  up.  My  kid  was  wo  his  adderall  for  a  week!
__label__m adderall  induced  a
__label__m i  feel  really  cheated  when  i'm  studying  pretty  hard  and  then  there  are  kids  on  adderall  who  don't  need  it
__label__m Zoey  don’t  smoke,  drink,  she  a  genius  and  a  virgin  dating  a  star  athlete  who  LIKES  the  fact  that  she  ain’t  fuckin..  she  took  like  3  adderall  and  that’s  it.  If  this  posed  to  make  college  look  realistic  it  don’t  .  Lmao
__label__m _U  Thanks  for  update  on  Tramadol
__label__c besides.  i'll  have  my  oxycontin  on  deck,  so  i  won't  feel  a  thing.
__label__m Started  crying  the  popped  a  valium,  turned  up  the  volume.
__label__m “_U:  adderall  had  me  studying  for  a  test  but  getting  sidetracked  and  researching  conspiracy  theories”  _U  illuminati
__label__c thanks  vyvanse  for  making  my  entire  body  shake..
__label__m I  think  I  legitimately  need  a  prescription  for  Xanax.
__label__u I'm  tired  of  Lyrica  name  dropping  #LHHH
__label__m _U  _U  U  talk  as  seems  U've  taken  some  tramadol,wat  of  those  who  have  completed  University,Polytecnics  n  order  high  schools  qualifications  n  are  still  hm  without  employment?  Y  always  nurses!
__label__c like  bitch  do  u  know  how  many  days  i  have  where  I  want  to  work  so  badly  and  even  with  adderall  for  ADHD  i  can't  do  it
__label__c xanax  is  the  only  thing  getting  me  thru  today.  thats  sad  af
__label__m have  hardening  of  the  nipples?you  probably  have  tourettes.this  causes  numbness.try  abilify
__label__a _U  I  will  need  some  Valium  or  something  for  awhile,  it's  really  going  to  be  hard  at  first...for  sometime.    Lots  of  drugs  and  alone  time.    Really.    I'm  okay  with  that.
__label__m some  people  are  so  dense,  take  a  xanax  and  chill  the  fuck  out  dude  🙄
__label__m suboxone  is  very  expensive  and  addictive.  #chasingheroin
__label__a still  fucked  up  off  this  adderall
__label__m _U  _U  More  versions  of  Adderall?  I'm  good.  I  know  half  the  fgc  around  the  world  are  on  it  like  it's  an  enhancement  drug  lol
__label__m i  hope  all  of  u  get  a  xanax  and  a  shoulder  massage  for  xmas
__label__m Driving  while  on  XaNaX  is  not  a  good  idea
__label__m DO  YE  KNOW  HOW  MUCH  XANAX  I  WOULD  NEED  FOR  THIS  #RoyalWedding
__label__c da  xanax  got  me  movin  slow..
__label__u Yes  Lyrica  cover  that  botched  booty  up
__label__m _U  ....oh  come  on  there  are  some  fentanyl  and  Oxycontin  uses  at  trumps  rallies....  you're  cheering  on  your  own  death
__label__c adderall  all  in  my  system
__label__a i  just  finished  a  weeks  worth  of  homework  in  a  matter  of  6  hours,  i  would  not  only  like  to  thank  adderall  but  also  adderall
__label__a i  got  the  real  morphine  in  using  percocet  percocet
__label__m _U  Where  did  that  even  enter  the  previous  conversation.  Take  an  Ativan
__label__u i  hope  lyrica  doesn't  get  too  close  to  the  other  girls  because  most  of  them  will  turn  against  her  #lhhh
__label__m Me:  “my  cramps  hurt”  Joe”you  need  anything?  Morphine,  fentanyl,  heroin?”    Me:  “no  I’m  good  😂”
__label__c When’s  the  Valium  gonna  kick  in  bc  I’m  panicking  about  being  so  horribly  fatigued
__label__c _U  gabapentin  is  #1.  i  went  580ish  days  with  no  pain  meds  at  all,  because  i  was  convince  i  was  an  addict  from  what  people  told  me.
__label__m Cw:  drugs    I  took  a  little  hydrocodone  and  my  brain  thinks  I  could  eat  some  pizza  but  I  really  can't.
__label__m my  mom  actually  just  suggested  selling  adderall  as  a  legitimate  means  of  supporting  myself  #what  #mamaraisedadrugdealer
__label__m _U  That  adderall  episode  😂😂😂
__label__a Alcohol  +  drugs  +  Valium  -  know  I  know  to  sleep  feeling  like  shit  about  myself  and  hoping  I’ve  taken  enough  to  not  wake  up  in  the  morning.  I  have  regrets  and  I’ll  live  with  those  as  long  as  I’ve  got  left
__label__m _U  gonna  take  a  hell  of  a  lot  of  valium  if  you  lot  qualify.  have  you  tried  wonga?
__label__m YUUUUUUUUNG  LEEEEEEAN    UP  IN  THE  CLUB  4  SUM'  MORPHINE
__label__a since  I  fucked  with  Xanax  I  haven't  been  able  to  find  stability,  it's  almost  been  a  year  that  I've  been  sober  too.
__label__c Um,  yeah.  NO  they  don't.  I've  been  on  40-90MME  in  conjunction  with  MS  Contin.  I  do  NOT  get  high.  I  don't  even  get  a  head  rush.  They  mute  the  pain  and  help  me  get  around  a  bit.  You've  either  gone  thru  addiction  yourself,  or  had  someone  close  to  you  have  a  prob  with  Opioids.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Absolutely!  As  a  teacher,  I  see  our  kids  on  a  really  bad  road,  many  already  addicted  to  adderall  etc...,  but  the  profits  made  off  of  them  are  in  the  BILLIONS!  So  thats  OK,  but  #Kratom  is  dangerous?
__label__a _U  Lots  of  weed,  2  tramadol,  more  weed  then  2  Valium  just  to  top  the  night  off.  It  is  Friday!!!
__label__m i'm  in  the  doctors  waiting  room  surround  by  4  children  and  2  parents  who  must  be  on  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  ....and  for  that  reason  we  should  keep  it  illegal?  do  we  have  a  roadside  test  for  oxycontin  yet?
__label__m my  tweets  need  adderall
__label__m my  mom  abt  me  babysitting  tomorrow:  go  to  bed,  get  lots  of  sleep.  take  a  valium  before  you  go
__label__c _U    how  suboxone  saved  my  life.  i
__label__c Oxycodone  doesn't  feel  like  being  in  a  warm  bath,  anyone  who  says  so  is  wrong.  Oxycodone  feels  like  BEING  A  warm  bath.  I  am  the  bath.  I  wash  over  myself  and  overflow!
__label__a this  hydrocodone  got  me  rollin
__label__c Adderall  made  me  shit    Bottom  text
__label__m _U  adderall  is  for  add.  it's  to  boost  attention  &  focus.  it's  usually  taken  by  dumbfucks  that  don't  have  add.
__label__m did  nothing  just  admit  to  adderall  on  the  stream
__label__c _U  Thank  you  for  this,  srsly!  This  is  taking  a  huge  toll  on  CP  patients.  I  am  a  CPP  (Degenerative  Disc  &  Joint  Disease)  and  have  been  forced  to  take  Suboxone  for  3  yrs  bc  everybody  is  scared  to  RX  the  amount  of  pain  medication  I  *need.*  Suboxone  offers  very  little  pain  relief.
__label__m bxtch  i'm  on  twelve  xanax  rn
__label__m _U  She  was  pretty  animated  -  I’m  thinking  more  Valium  and/or  tranquilizer  dart.
__label__u lyrica  -  feenin  ft.  kevin  gates    has  to  be  one  of  my  new  favorite  songs  cuz
__label__m _U  only  if  its  oxycodone

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  are  we  talking  about  oxycontin  or  something  else?
__label__m _U  50  mg  of  Vyvanse,  Effexor,  and  weekly  sessions  with  a  counselor  to  teach  her  to  love  herself.
__label__a _U  i  took  an  adderall  in  college  just  to  see  what  would  happen  n  was  up  all  that  night  n  all  the  next  day.  i  can  see  it  bein  a  ped
__label__a _U  Stufff  happens.  I  spent  election  night  juiced  to  the  eyebrows  on  morphine.  Made  it  less  painful
__label__a Brother...  It's  such  a  crazy  fucked  up  road.  I've  always  loved  u  and  your  work.  Fucking  opiates  and  methadone  pushed  me  to  the  brink  of  death  so  many  times.  2012  was  the  last  time.  Blew  close  to  200k  of  family's    $  by  being  a  lying  cheating  piece  of  shit.  Hard  to  live  w  myself...

__label__m Note  to  self:  pop  a  Xanax  before  watching  #DWTS  finales
__label__a i  need  more  adderall  to  save  my  grades
__label__a I  put  this  on  last  night  and  let  me  tell  you  I  want  some  Adderall  asap.  I  mean  I  fell  asleep  3/4  of  the  way  through  so  what  does  that  tell  you

__label__c _U  Thrilled  that  you  are  doing  something  about  opioid  addiction.However,  I  am  having  difficulty  getting  Tramadol  for  chronic  pain!!
__label__m _U  _U  Take  a  Xanax
__label__a _U  😳  shit  better  make  you  have  a  12  pack  overnight  or  something!  75$  is  crazy...  i  go  with  a  redbull  or  vyvanse💊
__label__m _U  I'm  pretty  sure  this  comes  down  to  how  profitable  the  research  is  -  medical  and  chemical  patents  are  big  money  for  universities  ...  just  look  at  what  Lyrica  did  for  Northwestern
__label__c _U  That  response  is  a  little.....over  the  top,  shall  we  say?    She  makes  the  statement  as  if  it  is  a  FACT,  not  her  opinion.  Kind  of  the  same  way  she  made  the  statement  I  illegally  obtain  &  sell  my  suboxone.  then  referred  to  me  as  a  "DRUGGIE",  all  because  I  tried  to  HELP  her.
__label__c Heck  no🌝.    I  wake  up  and  hit  the  floor  running  -straight  for  the  coffee  pot  and  Fox  and  Friends.  Some  of  those  prescription  drugs  designed  just  for  sleep  can  really  mess  you  up  the  next  day.    Xanax  for  relaxation  and  OTC  sleep  gel  cap  is  money  👍
__label__m _U  tad!  i  wish  i  could  get  valium  for  that
__label__m _U  zyprexa  is  for  voices  its  a  strong  pill  it  will  make  u  weak  and  dry  mouth
__label__m almost  positive  dunkin  puts  adderall  in  their  iced  coffees
__label__c _U  just  got  diagnosed  with  cool  guy  syndrome!  now  i  take  adderall!
__label__c _U  zoloft  did  nothing  for  me  at  all  xanax  the  new  heroin
__label__m not  that  i  would  use  it...  but  times  like  these  are  when  i  wish  i  had  adderall
__label__c i  had  every  intention  on  taking  an  adderall  today  but  then  i  realized,  today  is  about  eating..
__label__m adderall  is  essentially  meth  know  what  you  are  putting  into  your  body  !!!!
__label__c (drugs  tw)    Advice:  don’t  take  oxycodone  on  an  empty  stomach  just  bc  you  wake  up  hurting  like  I  did  because  then  you  are  goofy  stoned  and  sleepy  for  several  hours.    Or  yknow,  do,  just  know  what  you’re  signing  up  for.
__label__m _U  That  &  some  cocaine  Ativan  cocktails.  Mixed  in  with  some  second  stage  syphilis  perhaps?
__label__m _U  only  the  xanax  factory  can  help  her  at  this  point.
__label__m and  a  xanax  to  make  it  all  right
__label__c am  i  in  love  with  my  nurse  or  does  she  just  bring  me  morphine?  yes
__label__a Can  someone  take  over  my  twitter  while  I’m  on  morphine
__label__c i  have  the  best  best  best  coworkers.  just  got  a  load  of  xanax  for  my  vacation  for  free  👌👌
__label__m _U  is  it  better  than  Adderall  tho?
__label__m _U  You  can't  really  get  high  off  suboxone.  It's  not  like  taking  Vicodin  every  couple  hours  to  keep  the  buzz  going.  He  should  be  taking  it  to  avoid  having  a  "rough  day".
__label__m _U  what  the  fuck  is  xanax
__label__c _U  Actual  Sleep  or  just  the  usually  unconsciousness?  Lol.  Drs  had  me  on  fn  everything  for  7  yrs.  Morphine,  oxy,  di,  fen,  percs,  Vic,  pain  pumps,  Xanax,  lorazepam,  flexeril,  Ambien,  etc.  Finally  told  em  to  f  themselves  and  420  saved  my  perverted  life.
__label__u _U  You  mean  69  Terriyaki  and  Lil  Xanax  aren’t  as  good  as  Biggie  &  Pac?
__label__c I’ve  been  on  adderall  on  and  off  for  over  a  decade.  Haven’t  lost  any  teeth  or  been  arrested  (yet).  Here’s  how  I  mitigate  the  meth-like  side  effects:  /6
__label__m _U  can  i  at  least  have  one  xanax  or  two?  😂😂😂
__label__m _U  _U  pushes  #ADDICTION  with  dangerously  #ADDICTIVE  #LYRICA!  US  has  a  nat'l  public  health  crisis.  #NBC  has  #BigPharma  #BloodMoney  #DrugThug  #GREED  but  NO  SOCIAL  CONSCIOUSNESS!!!
__label__m _U  You  banned  codeine  and  left  tramadol  ?  This  people  are  joking
__label__c They  just  started  the  tramadol.  Hope  it's  the  last  dose  of  my  life.  Headache  has  improved  but  entire  spinal  column  is  stiff  &  sore
__label__m _U  _U  tis  valium  i  need!
__label__c _U  Meds  include  mouthwashes,  morphine  pca,  ketamine.  Distraction,  humidified  air  overnight,  ice-chips  if  not  too  painful.
__label__m _U  But  Trump  wasn’t  a  puppet  of  the  Muslim  brotherhood  or  a  proponent  of  the  Saul  Alinsky  handbook  for  radicals.  So  glad  to  see  you  have  nothing  better  to  focus  on.  Go  take  some  Valium.  Aren’t  you  fat?
__label__c _U  I'm  on  Dyphenhydramine  for  sleeping,  I'm  just  coming  off  pregabalin  and  thats  messing  with  my  body  more  than  going  on  it.
__label__m _U  Klonopin  or  black  heart

Conservatives  were  questioning  Hillary’s  health  bc  she  wore  a  pantsuit  in  the  summer  or  her  bodyguard  was  secretly  injecting  her  with  diazepam  during  a  speech.
__label__m How  much  xanax  do  you  think  she  takes    #morningjoe  _U
__label__m if  you  still  cannot  spell  xanax  yo  ass  definitely  don’t  need  to  be  poppin  them  jawns  😂

__label__c oh.  _U  has  made  a  medical  decision  for  me.  they  deny  my  lyrica  coverage  because  they  don't  "deem  it  medically  necessary."    ...
__label__m _U  If  President  Trump  had  any  clue  he  would  realize  that  if  he  wants  the  death  penalty  for  drug  pushers  of  oxy,  fentanyl,  percoset  and  morphine  he  is  going  to  be  hanging  doctors  and  pharma  company  CEO's.    Jerk.
__label__c I  had  morphine  today  and  that  shit  was  cool,  and  also  I’m  most  likely  getting  surgery  on  my  wrist  WOOHH
__label__m So  let  me  get  this  right.  You  take  300  tramadol  (prescription  tablets)  to  a  country  where  they  are  illegal  and  then  you  and  your  family  whine  about  the  fact  you’ve  been  sentenced  for  the  crime...  Oh  and  a  colleague  put  them  in  your  bag...

__label__c oxycodone  is  gonna  be  my  new  friend  for  the  next  couple  days
__label__m _U  I’ll  make  sure  to  ask  my  doctor  for  some  Xanax  before  then.  Omg  this  was  INSANE.

__label__c I  was  told  I  had  anxiety.  So  I  took  Ativan  and  Klonopin.  The  "anxiety"  got  so  bad  that  these  drugs  didn't  work  because  it  wasn't  anxiety.    Mental  illness  is  often  misdiagnosed  and  minimized  and  women  are  often  not  listened  to  because  obviously  we're  just  "overreacting."
__label__a _U  I'm  fairly  positive  tramadol  didn't  even  give  me  a  buzz  and  I  have  no  tolerance  for  pills  again  ever  since  I  got  clean.  Shits  weak
__label__a not  when  you  sprinkle  vyvanse  in  your  coffee  and  i  will  fite  u  about  it  off  😂🔫
__label__c so  i'm  about  to  take  my  vyvanse  after  being  off  of  it  for  several  months.  i've  just  been  sitting  staring  at  it  all  morning.

__label__m people  need  to  stop  doing  them  xanax  cause  they  be  looking  fool  up😭
__label__a Ok  honestly  I  know  I  drank  a  cold  brew  coffee  before  bed  but  I  countered  it  with  two  Ativan  so  honestly  how  am  I  still  awake/alive
__label__a watch  me  drop  that  2mg  xanax  in  my  sprite
__label__m u  take  xanax  and  ur  parents  are  divorced  so  who  has  the  better  family  for  a  dog?

__label__m If  methadone  is  free  to  junkies  because  "addiction  is  a  disease",  then  cancer  patients  shouldn't  have  to  pay  for  treatment,  as  they  never  CHOSE  to  get  cancer.  Addicts  made  a  choice  to  get  high  knowing  the  risk.
__label__m _U  There  was  more  to  his  tweet  than  that.  And  saying  take  a  Valium  is  like  saying  calm  down.  Your  off  your  meds  is  calling  someone  nuts.

I  said  I  had  some  decent  ones,  they  lowered  their  voice  and  said  "no  I've  got  some  serious  painkillers"    Co-codomol.      Bless  their  cotton  socks.    I've  got  dihydrocodeine,  tramadol,  fentanyl  and  pregabalin.  I  might  actually  die.

__label__a _U  took  enough  adderall  to  kill  a  grown  elephant  this  week
__label__m _U  1.  Did  not  know  that  Kroger  (Fred  Meyer)  sold  guns  anyway.    2.  They  should  also  stop  dispensing  Oxycontin  in  the  pharmacy.  3.  What  about  all  that  alcohol  on  the  shelves?    4.  All  that  high  sodium  in  their  processed  meats  at  the  deli.
__label__c I  gotta  talk  about  a  medication  that  my  life  would  literally  be  100  times  worse  if  i  did  not  have.  Gabapentin.  It  is  used  for  nerve  pain  and  seizures.  Its  a  lot  like  Lyrica  for  #Fibromyalgia  patients  whose  insurance  won’t  cover  Lyrica.
__label__m _U  The  usual:  say  it’s  substituting  one  drug  for  another,  and  point  out  widespread  diversion  and  abuse,  latter  of  which  which  is  true  in  some  areas  where  pill  mill-type  Suboxone  clinics  have  been  allowed  to  proliferate  largely  unchecked  —  but  deserves  more  nuanced  discussion.

__label__m _U  Have  to  do  something  about  the  root  problem  of  suicides.  Medication  addictive  drugs,  street  drugs.  We  can  put  a  stop  to  it.  My  friend  ended  up  with  his  mind  gone  that  had  hunged  himself  &  the  name  is  OXYCODONE.

__label__m _U  The  same  way  methadone  or  buprenorphine  is  treatment.  They  all  help  manage  withdrawal  symptoms,  restore  balance,  and  reduce  need  to  engage  in  behaviors  to  seek  out  street  drugs.

__label__c _U  i  do  shots  and  sublingual  drops  for  the  supplements,  oxycodone  (without  acetaminophen,  just  the  straight  oxycodone),  monthly  shot
__label__c _U  I  had  a  tramadol  once  and  couldn’t  shit  for  like  3  days.
__label__m I  completely  agree,  therapist  suggest  you  should  see  a  psychiatrist  to  prescribe  you  narcotic  benzos  which  are  highly  addictive  medication  for  most  people  who  don't  necessarily  need  it  especially  Adderall  is  extremely  abused...  who's  physicians  don't  even  care  about  their  patient
__label__m so...i  forgot  to  put  the  ativan  in  my  pocket.  😑
__label__m my  cramps.....they  are  So  Bad.......please............morphine

__label__m _U  _U  13  years  of  a  methadone  cycle  of  HELL  is  not  an  opinion!  No  need  for  anyone  who  wants  to  live  free  &  clean  to  be  imprisoned  by  a  synthetic  drug  from  hell!
__label__m good  point  about  the  brain  stimulants,  cascio!  reminds  me  of  the  adderall  usage  in  the  hbo  series  silicon  valley!  #rasp15
__label__m do  you  think  valium  fucks  you  up  the  same  way  xans  do?????
__label__m _U  Cannabis  would  be  a  better  exit  drug  for  heroin  users  rather    than  methadone.A  drug  which  is  actually  good  for  you.
__label__m _U  Not  having  any  other  way  to  rid  himself  of  whatever  disgustingly  domestic  feeling  is  building  up  inside  him,  Jim  has  a  medic  bring  him  some  morphine.  Once  it's  delivered,  he  quickly  injects  it,  glad  for  the  swiftly-appearing  high  that  practically  knocks  him  out.
__label__a if  any  of  y'all  could  find  xanax  hit  my  dm  :////

__label__m _U  _U  _U  Let's  do  some  basic  math  you  negative  IQ  blowhard.      500+  companies  and  a  few  failures.      That's  a  90%  +  success  rate.      How  many  businesses  do  you  own  or  run?      Selling  hydrocodone  to  your  cousin  doesnt  cut  it.
__label__m Everybody  is  so  professional  when  it  comes  to  suboxone  aroun  here  😂
__label__m _U  Bags  of  off-brand  animal  crackers  and  the  kind  of  hard  candies  nobody  wants.  But  lots  of  Ativan!
__label__c i  don't  think  vyvanse  and  physical  activity  go  together  i  am  going  to  puke

__label__m _U  its  the  adderall  talking.

__label__a My  bf  says  when  I  talk  about  my  problems  and  take  a  bunch  of  xanax  and  he's  too  tired  to  listen  to  all  this.
__label__c _U  This  is  actually  a  huge  problem  for  me  too  bc  if  I  take  quetiapine  while  in  a  call  I  will  just  shut  down  so  I  always  postpone  it

__label__m ugh  the  dude  with  the  klonopin  handle  doesn't  use  it  and  in  fact  sucks
__label__m _U  _U  If  pt  is  dependent  then  he  will  die  quickly  if  not  immediately.  What  about  asking  palliative  care  to  give  high  dose  morphine.  It  is  more  comfortable  for  pt  and  less  traumatic  to  the  family
__label__m _U  So  if  Yurinators  have  crack,  Sooperstars  have  Xanax.  HAHAHAJSJDKDKDKFLGLG

__label__m #shareourpain    The  pm  clinic  I  was  going  to  go  to  only  used  the  anti  addiction  med,  i  think.  With  telecom,  random  screening,  pill  counts,  etc.  I  don't  want  to  go  all  that  way  for  methadone,  subutex  or  suboxone.  I'll  call  them  today  to  find  out  if  it's  true
__label__m _U  I'm  glad  you  got  through  the  worst  of  it!  The  morphine  will  help  you  sleep  well  tonight  which  is  the  first  step  to  recovery!!!

__label__m i  sprained  my  ankle  on  a  curb  drunk  off  my  ass  while  ppl  laughed  at  me.  why  the  doc  ddnt  prescribe  me  the  oxycodone  i  askd  for  is  beyond  me.
__label__a can  see  why  the  doc  was  telling  me  diazepam  is  addictive!
__label__m Stop  doing  central  nervous  system  depressants  baby  xanax  and  alcohol  not  gonna  heal  you
__label__m _U  This  must  be  confusing  for  people  using  it  to  buy  OxyContin.

__label__c now  i  know  why  you  shouldn't  take  adderall  at  4:30  in  the  afternoon  #waytogomelly
__label__c _U  I'd  like  to  think  that  would  never  happen  but  then  I  see  his  career  (that  he's  actually  had  a  career)  and  I  reach  for  the  Valium.
__label__c so  much  anxiety,  so  little  xanax  lol
__label__m Reading  between  the  lines  of  the  news  reports,  I'm  guessing  that  it's  a  couple  of  drug  addicts  who  have  been  given  a  tampered-with  bottle  of  methadone  at  the  local  Boots  chemist.    Possibly  original  contents  stolen  by  another  addict  and  replaced  with  something  toxic.  All  guessing.
__label__a Who's  got  adderall  asking  4  a  friend
__label__m @gordonkeith  gabapentin  can  also  be  used  for  peripheral  limb  pain.  keeps  the  same  channel  open  in  the  brain  that  alcohol  affects.
__label__c when  you  start  spiralling  and  can't  catch  yourself  before  you  lose  it,  that's  why  ativan  was  invented...
__label__m My  Pops  was  doing  Valium  n  shit  wit  David  Ruffin  in  a  limo  on  the  way  to  a  funeral  😭😭😭😭😭
__label__c _U  Just  on  way  home  from  Wembley  next  stop  valium  city  😂😂😂
__label__m _U  What  up  Artie,  hope  everythings  ok  bro.  I've  been  snortin  for  5  years,  promised  I  would  never  shoot.  Is  Methadone  worse  than  h?  Thinkin  bout  tryin  a  clinic.  Any  experience  with  Kratom?  Heard  its  good  for  wds.  Hope  you  stay  clean  man,  working  on  myself  now,  get  well.
__label__c _U  I  say  “eleventeen”      Yeah,  Tramadol  was  my  go  to  med  when  they  first  got  super  strict  but  like  you  said  it’s  somehow  a  opioid  now    I  despised  my  last  Pain  Management  clinic,  not  only  was  it  a  monthly  visit  and  urine  samples,  they  treated  people  like  addicts
__label__c _U  it's  ok  i  got  an  IV,  some  anti-nausea  meds  and  some  xanax  bc  i  told  the  dr  how  badly  my  mom  stresses  me  out
__label__c adderall  keep  me  hype  everyday

__label__m _U  _U  Ever  known  anyone  with  chronic  pain?  The  helplessness  because  you  can  only  do  so  much?  Who  are  you  to  judge?  How  much  would  300  tramadol  get  on  the  Egyptian  black  market?  Not  a  lot  I  would  guess  when  more  serious  drugs  abound.
__label__a i've  been  getting  too  high  lately,  percocets  and  codeine  please  don't  take  my  life  😖😖🙏
__label__m I  bet  there  is  a  xanax  dispenser  in  the  White  House  at  the  door  like  a  sanitizer  stand.
__label__m My  dad  died  of  cancer  3  years  ago  at  age  59.  While  was  a  lifelong  addict  &  alcoholic  hospice  &  VA  fed  him  oxycodone  round  the  clock  &  later  morphine.  He  needed  it!  At  that  point  what  does  addiction  or  no  addiction  matter!  It’s  their  job  to  ease  their  suffering  when  dying  agony!
__label__c Sometimes  I  don't  know  if  its  lack  of  coffee,  the  codeine  plus  gabapentin  from  last  night,  or  the  gabapentin  this  morning,  or  the  fact  I've  been  joking  about  early  onset  alzheimers  since  before  I  found  out  short  term  memory  was  another  side  effect  of  PTSD.
__label__m _U  like  you  took  an  adderall
__label__m Nearly  every  time  I've  gone  to  the  hospital  in  pain,  I've  been  abused  tho.  I  just  didn't  happen  to  die.  Their  indifference  was  staggering.  Oddly,  they  hooked  my  son  to  morphine  before  he  even  saw  the  Dr.  I  didn't  know  they  could  even  do  that!  If  you're  male  it's  a  different  world

__label__m i  told  my  dad  abt  how  i  was  diagnosed  w  ADHD  after  asking  him  if  his  side  of  my  bloodline  had  a  history  of  seizures  (i  want  to  switch  to  adderall  but  there’s  a  Risk  bc  of  my  wellbutrin  rx)  and  i  guess  my  dad  is  an  ADHD  truther?
__label__c _U  ah  yes.  I  do  have  full  mental  health  coverage  with  Medicaid.  when  I  get  dumped,  I  will  be  able  to  refill  my  klonopin.
__label__m _U  adderall  xr  is  some  quality  stuff.
__label__m _U  The  gold  standard  for  medication  assisted  treatment  is  still  methadone,  suboxone  and  naltrexone.    Lots  of  claims  for  marijuana  but  not  much  good  research  -  yet.
__label__m i  was  talking  about  adderall
__label__c _U  _U  _U  i  went  through  15  valium  last  week
__label__c _U  Ok,  as  crazy  as  the  Valium  is  that  there  is  NO  PAIN!
__label__c Aspirin?  Tylenol,  Advil?  Morphine?  none  of  it  helps  me,  asking,  begging  for  a  plea,  I'm  crying,  whining,i  think  i'm  dying.  Can  you  blame  me?
__label__m not  thinking  straight  blurring  all  the  lines,  you  intoxicate  me  just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine,  suddenly,  I'm  a  fiend  and  you're  all  I  need  🎵

__label__m _U  Of  course  the  seroquel  is  gonna  make  u  drowsy,  its  for  sleeping  more  then  anything  suppose  to  be.  You'll  see  big  difference  if  u  take  at  night  I  think

__label__a _U  wants  to  do  Xanax  and  say  fuck  god.  What  is  wrong  with  you
__label__m Hospice  is  basically  starving  a  patient  to  death  &  using  Morphine  or  other  strong  drugs  to  keep  them  sedated.    Very  scary.    Not  the  ideal  way  to  end  life.    I  want  to  go  out  ROSE  KENNEDY  Style.....Decades  of  nurses  &  round-the-clock  care  at  home!!
__label__m give  me  a  paper  towel  give  me  another  valium  gimme  another  hour  or  two  hour  with  you  💜
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  OxyContin  and  Ritalin  don’t  mix  well
__label__a the  only  way  i'd  be  able  to  do  all  my  homework  is  if  i  had  200mg  of  adderall  and  no  life
__label__a i  have  four  tramadols  and  a  valium  in  my  system  accompanied  by  two  12oz  coors  so  yeah  today  is  my  off  day
__label__m _U  _U  Add  some  tequila  and  xanax  and  you'll  be  fine
__label__m _U  Thanks,  she's  on  high  pain  meds,and  morphine  patches,  but  she  wants  to  come  off  them,x
__label__m _U  _U  300  tramadol  is  only  a  5  week  supply  of  taking  at  maximum  dose  so  not  unrealistic  for  her  to  have  been  prescribed  them.
__label__c now's  the  perfect  time  to  take  quetiapine  wew
__label__c Thank  u  adderall  &  xanax😩💔

__label__c _U  _U  They  already  sleep  and  I  just  took  a  hydrocodone  so  IT’S  ON!!!!
__label__m "every  form  of  addiction  is  bad,  no  matter  whether  the  narcotic  be  alcohol,  morphine  or  idealism."    c.g.  jung  #psychology  #quote
__label__c _U  A  valid  point.    I  have  been  hospitalized  3  times  for  things  3  times  in  last  5  years  &  each  time  when  being  released  they  said,  "We're    gunna  Rx  u  some  Oxycodone".    And  I  told  them  each  time  I  won't  take  it.    And  they  say,  "Well,  just  in  case."    I'm  stocked  with  it.    Amazing.
__label__m _U  _U  1  mg  of  morphine  is  closer  to  0.25  mg  dilaudid  than  2  mg  morphine  is...
__label__c _U  Playing  5  a  side  at  uni.  Went  in  for  a  tackle  and  my  foot  got  planted  and  twisted.  The  hour  long  wait  for  the  ambulance  was  horrible.  Morphine,  gas  and  air  are  great  though
__label__m If  I  took  tramadol  ive  had  probs  wi  and  then  stabbed  up  my  hubby  I'd  be  in  jail.  _U  im  white  a  fmale  not  middleclass  #wrightstuff
__label__a _U  i  was  taking  adderall  daily  and  drinking  a  lot  of  caffeine  and  eating  sugar  with  it  and  i  only  slept  like  4-6  hour  nights  lol
__label__c i  ate  300  calories  of  oxycodone  for  breakfast.
__label__c Another  night  of  scratching  like  a  crackhead  because  of  this  hydrocodone.  But  I  need  it  to  sleep  through  this  pain  😩😩😩
__label__m _U  Ah!!  U  add  tramadol  anaa??  😂😂😂
__label__c i  should  probably  try  taking  my  adderall  regularly  again  but  uugh
__label__m _U  How  do  you  know  he's  not  on  5  klonopin  or  something
__label__c idk  if  i  can  take  my  trazodone  bcuz  if  the  hydrocodone  hasnt  completely  worn  off  tht'd  be  bad  but  i  wan  sleep    ..  now
__label__m _U  my  mom  said  she  wanted  to  take  a  xanax  before  mine  and  i  was  like  nooo  😂🙈
__label__u Lyrica  literally  did  the  most

__label__m oz  delivered  in  less  than  an  hour...  the  audacity  of  our  people.  let  me  know  how  xanax  is  treating  you.  oh  yeah,  i  forgot  oxycottin  too.
__label__m _U  _U  Hahaha!  See?  😂😂😂  These  rappers  with  their  multi  colored  baby  dread  &  face  tatooes  are  just  weird.  They  put  zero  effort  into  their  songs  &  spend  the  rest  of  their  time  poppin  Xanax  pills  &  taking  pics  with  machine  guns.  Its  crazy
__label__m _U  Her  camhs  doctor  told  me  to  take  her  to  the  GP  but  I  can't  bear  thought  of  yet  more  meds...he  has  her  on  Aripriprazole  and  ADHD  meds  and  low  dose  Fluoxetine  which  he  maintains  help  mood  swings...his  words...i'm  not  happy  with  all  that  at  14....
__label__c what  better  way  to  enjoy  my  oxycodone  than  with  a  raunchy  movie
__label__m _U  That's  exactly  what  they  did  to  my  father  who  had  #dementia.They  couldn't  handle  him  so  they  kept  giving  him  #seroquel    #PeninsulaReflectionsNursingHome  😬
__label__m "with  less  pain,  i  feel  better."  wow,  thanks,  lyrica  commercial  lady,  for  that  lesson  in  the  obvious.  i'm  sold.

__label__m zenia  needs  to  take  her  xanax  ass  to  sleep
__label__m _U  He  is  a  sleep  now,  nothing  conclusive,  so  just  lots  more  tests  at  the  moment.  He  still  had  the  chest  pain  even  after  oral  morphine  😱
__label__m _U  you  looked  tired  in  that  picture.  did  you  get  jumped  or  something?  xanax  isn't  what's  poppin.
__label__a wow  such  adderall    many  focus
__label__m at  the  risk  of  taking  it  too  far,  it's  worth  noting  that  coal  mining  is  probably  the  one  problem  that  oxycodone  can  actually  solve.
__label__u Not  even  sillying  myself  by  getting  excited  for  the  new  series  of  Still  Game.  The  last  one  was  toilet  and  Methadone  Mick  isn't  funny  in  the  slightest.

__label__c adderall  is  my  coffee
__label__c Phoenix  VA  making  me  go  cold  turkey  from  morphine  as  a  retaliatory  action.  Tiffany  Clemons  was  called  out  for  her  incompetency  and  she  retaliated.

__label__a I'm  taking  xanax  or  any  kind  of  anxiety  medication  as  a  form  of  gift  for  my  birthday  next  week.
__label__c Warning:  I  took  an  ambien  &  a  klonopin  an  hour  ago  and  I’m  still  not  tired  so  I’m  up  on  Twitter.      This  is  not  recommended  as  now  I’ll  make  wrong  judgement  calls  like  buy  beautiful  art  off  of  Etsy  that  I  can’t  afford
__label__u LOL  you  would  not  do  Lyrica  what  did  she  do  to  you  nothing  so  don't  do  that  and  disrespect  her  when  she  was  your  friend

__label__a how  can  u  debate  me  smoking  newports  when  u  do  xanax  and  occasionally  sniff  blow?  🤔
__label__a there  is  something  so  beautiful  about  a  xanax  bar  to  me..
__label__a _U  Pot  to  mellow  me  out,  cocaine  to  wake  me  back  up  again  and  morphine  well...  because  it's  awesome
__label__m _U  _U  legal  in  european  countries  until  mid20thc;  would  have  helped  my  father  with  pain  of  spinal  arthritis  better  than  morphine
__label__a adderall  had  me  interested  in  everything  but  studying
__label__m _U  Look  around  at  these  cretins.  Fortunately  I  love  in  a  blue  state  where  people  have  teeth  and  shoes  so  I  do  not  see  too  many  of  them.  Most  could  not  find  their  way  out  of  a  paper  bag  full  of  OxyContin.

__label__m Boy  can  I  relate  to  #Grownish  since  it’s  my  freshman.  They  showed  college  so  perfectly.  Accept  I  haven’t  done  Adderall  😂

__label__m i  just  googled  adderall  rap
__label__m stop  talking  about  xanax  in  music  unless  you're  making  fun  of  it
__label__m _U  _U  _U  give  me  effexor  and  some  seroquel  pls
__label__c this  adderall  is  low  key  killing  my  ass
__label__m seroquel  is  ok  with  the  guvmint.  it  can  kill  you.    but,  pain  patients  get  treated  like  they  walked  in  w/  a  syringe  stickin  out  of  their  arms
__label__m _U  thats  why  you  should  take  adderall
__label__m The  #NHS  system  is  to  blame  for  the  #opioidcrisis  in  the  UK.  As  GP's  escalate  meds  to  morphine,  patients  become  addicted.  Then  they  are  dumped.  GP's  do  not  facilitate  detox.  There  are  NHS  recovery  centres  in  the  UK  that  can  help.  But  not  many  people  know  about  them.
__label__m _U  _U  He  Saud  describe  her  in  two  words....you  need  a  valium.
__label__m _U  adderall  doesn't  prevent  injury  it's  prescribed  to  people  who  can't  focus  😅  and  yes  they  pay  the  consequences?  lol
__label__c gonna  start  taking  my  adderall  again
__label__c Hmu  if  u  wanna  pop  some  hydrocodone  and  listen  to  _U  in  the  dark  while  I  recover  from  surgery
__label__c I  had  studied  everything  except  that  semester.  I  was  the  only  one  who  failed  that  final.  He  was  a  lazy  teacher.  I  wasn't  lazy.  I  took  Valium
__label__m _U  Diazepam  pum
__label__c ...then  they  added  gabapentin  to  my  list  of  meds  for  pain  -  one  at  night  &  one  in  the  morning.    morning  one  on  own  is  fine...
__label__m _U  A  No  1  way  to  reduce  Harm  from  This  Epidemic  is  to  revamp  archaic  Legislation  regarding  The  use  of  #Methadone  for  #PainControl  and  #addiction  treatment.  Methadone  reduces  Cravings  /  Stops  Withdraw  -  While  BLOCKING  EUPHORIA  from  ALL  OPIATES!  Greatly  reducing  risk  of  Death.
__label__a the  one  night  i'm  on  fucking  adderall  and  my  friends  don't  wanna  go  out.
__label__m _U  Do  they  really  sell  Xanax  without  a  prescription  tho😨  that  would  be  madness

__label__a _U  anyway  hope  you're  all  well  and  good  and  doped  up  on  seroquel  or  something  like  i  am~  :dd  peace
__label__m _U  I  mean  I  am  against  xanax  but  I  see  how  people  definitely  are  like  that  lmao
__label__m Dr.  Cunningham:  in  some  US  states,  methadone  regulation  means  some  patients  can’t  access  this  medication.  Denying  or  limiting  access  to  treatment  to  this  degree  would  never  happen  if  this  were  diabetes  and  not  opioid  addiction  #AddictionResearchDay
__label__c sometimes  i  speed  in  school  zones,  from  the  adderall
__label__c my  vision  gets  blurry  after  taking  my  klonopin  is  that  like    a  normal  side  effect    or  should  I  mention  it  when  I  call  tomorrow
__label__c i  can  always  tell  when  my  adderall  is  wearing  off  when  i  start  stuttering  and  slurring  my  words  uncontrollably  🙃
__label__c _U  i  just  got  quetiapine  added.  i  take  50mg.  i  used  to  take  trazodone  but  it  didn't  seem  to  do  anything  for  me.
__label__a I  took  a  fucking  Valium  and  I  want  more
__label__m _U  _U  Its  going  on  for  yrs,  when  they  put  a  driver  (syringe)  in  the  neck  its  all  over  they  pump  you  full  of  morphine  the  body  shuts  down,  clinical  euthanasia  used  alot  in  unconscious  patients,  incase  they're  in  pain  is  the  excuse.
__label__c _U  that  this  isn't  the  end.  you  can  enquire  about  a  medication  that  i'm  on,  in  australia  it's  called  lyrica
__label__c adderall    comedown
__label__c the  xanax  from  yesterday  put  in  work
__label__c _U  _U  I  hope  you  are  ok  by  the  way.  This  is  a  disgusting  illness.  It  has  robbed  me  of  my  life.  The  pain  is  worst  part  of  it.  I  am  on  Tramadol  but  diff  to  keep  under  control.  Stress  does  not  help.
__label__m me:  "i'm  on  one."  _U  :  "bitch  one  what?  you  look  like  you  just  downed  xanax  with  bleach."

__label__m _U  _U  If  you  need  Xanax,  come  to  my  office.  I  am  thinking  you  may  need  to  chill  a  bit-  that  level  of  anger  will  stroke  you  out-we  are  going  to  get  through  this-  so  resist  Trump  but  it  is  ok  to  calm  down  folks💙
__label__u zombies  xanax  is  such  a  good  team  name,  how  did  they  come  up  with  it?
__label__c _U  i  take  abilify,  epilim,  lamotrigine  and  (if  needed)  clonazepam  and  temazepam.  works  well  for  me  but  everyone  is  different  :)
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  i  have  chronic  pain  also  and  suboxone  works  great  for  me.

__label__c I  was  speaking  about  using  #methadone  for  pain  treatment,  and  how  I  believe  it  should  remain  an  option  for  #ChronicPain,  but  be  SUPER  careful  if  you  should  choose  that  drug!  It's  a  tricky  one!  I  didn't  get  methadone  at  a  methadone  clinic,  but  a  pain  doc.  This  was  awhile  back...

__label__c _U  thank  u  i  spent  the  whole  time  debating  popping  a  valium
__label__c I  don’t  remember  the  last  time  my  Adderall  suppressed  my  appetite  and/or  helped  me  to  focus.  I  get  less  shit  done  when  I  take  it.
__label__c when  i  get  that  adderall  in  me  it's  game  over.
__label__m how  the  fuck  did  i  make  it  this  far  in  life  without  adderall
__label__c _U  Hahaha  that's  too  hard  core  for  me.  I'm  good  with  morphine  and  weed  😂

__label__a _U  _U  confession:  adderall  is  the  only  reason  i  passed  statics  /  college  😳😳
__label__m _U  why  was  a  low  life  junky  allowed  to  leave  a  methadone  clinic  under  the  influence  of  a  filthy  prescribed  government  drug
__label__m _U  Psychedelics  are  messier.  I  would  not  say  that  about  THC.  Maybe  CBD.    I'd  reframe  that  as:  morphine  poses  more  societal  risk  than  eg  dexamphetamine  as  one  is  a  depressant  and  the  other  a  stimulant.
__label__m _U  I  meant  feel  better  in  future,  lol.  Ofc  you  feel  fine  with  morphine  haha
__label__c _U  Dolo  Then  tramadol  (unwillingly)  Both  tried
__label__m _U  Military  healthcare  covers  addiction  medication  I.e  suboxone,  methadone  Infertility  medications:  clomid,  Estridol  Erectile  dysfunction  medications:  testosterone,  viagra,  tamoxifen  etc.    To  ban  Trans  people  for  using  medication  we  already  pay  for  for  not  Trans  troops  is  WRONG.

__label__c Taking  Klonopin  while  my  family  is  trying  to  get  Easter  together  was  probably  a  bad  idea.  I  don't  care  about  Easter  on  a  normal  year,  now  I  really  DGAF.
__label__c morphine  is  a  hell  of  a  drug  let  me  tell  you
__label__c i  like  klonopin  tho
__label__m Have  a  lack  of  motivation?Yes?You  suffer  from  Tourettes.This  causes  failure.Try  Xanax
__label__c I  need  this  Oxycodone  to  kick  in  cause  I’m  literally  dying
__label__c _U  THIS  IS  MY  POINT.  I’m  on  my  4th  IV  &  every  time  the  morphine  wears  off  I’m  literally  back  at  square  one.  My  main  dr  is  working  on  having  me  transferred  now  so  prayerfully  I  get  some  answers  soon
__label__m _U  _U  Ativan  and  trazadone  are  similar  yes.  They  are  sedating.  Those  are  just  (IMO)  drugs  I  wouldn’t  add  to  my  daily  routine.  Feel  the  same  about  ambien.  Slippery  slope.
__label__u 4:06  Morphine  -  Honey  White
__label__m _U  I'd  probably  need  valium  -  have  a  serious  problem  with  heights,  considerably  more  than  getting  incinerated!  But  would  be  amazing  to  see.
__label__m Just  like  nicotine,heroin,morphine  Suddenly,  I'm  a  fiend  and  your  all  I  need.  😫🎶
__label__a I  took  adderall  to  write  my  paper  and  now  I'm  focused  on  everything  except  my  paper
__label__m if  i  was  a  famous  rapper  i'd  overdose  on  lean  or  xanax  and  die  with  the  quickness
__label__m adderall  clearly  the  wackiest  drug  ever
__label__c adderall  had  me  reading  like  a  fucking  machine  for  the  past  4  hours
__label__c They  keep  giving  me  Valium  here  and  while  I'm  not  opposed  per  se,  it's  just  25mg  in  24  hours  seems  a  lot?
__label__m Fentanyl  derivatives  most  often  found  in  counterfeit  Norco,  Percocet,  or  Alprazolam  look-alikes  #ACMT2018
__label__m "Bitch  you  need  to  get  back  on  xanax."
__label__m Opioid  policies  have  done  only  harm.  Harm  to  those  suffering  with  real  debilitating  illness  &  injury,  as  well  as  harm  to  those  battling  SUDs.  This  was  all  done  to  push  Suboxone/Buprenorphine  onto  the  market.  This  was  never  about  helping  people.  OD  deaths  continue  to  skyrocket.🤨

__label__a i’ve  discovered  during  a  lot  of  time  spent  on  adderall  that  i  produce  a  substantial  amount  of  nutt  and  it’s  weird  but  i  can  push  out  a  nutt  in  command  whatever  the  occasion.  it’s  like  a  damn  weapon  wheel  select  menu  irl.  i  can  CHOOSE  to  nutt  or  pee

__label__m Quote  of  the  night:  "vyvanse  made  her  SUCH  a  bitch"
__label__c _U  takes  years  to  recognise  signs,  and  double  dose  of  quetiapine,  im  allowed  to  up  and  down  meds  as  an  when  :)
__label__c adderall  has  me  up  all  night  again

__label__m ya  niggas  gon  die  with  all  that  xanax  and  lean  consumption
__label__m _U  another  update:  he's  now  off  the  morphine  because  it's  making  him  worse  and  is  on  several  more  drips  with  anti  sickness  meds
__label__c can't  wait  to  take  this  fucking  seroquel  and  go  to  bed
__label__m _U  haha!  you  did  look  like  a  rug  on  valium  at  times.  shades  on  in  bed.  not  having  a  clue  what  the  hell  people  were  on  about
__label__m _U  Pedialite,  distilled  water  &  fruits.  Existential  crisis  Ativan  &  aspirin.
__label__m omg  the  1975  are  not  breaking  up  you  all  need  to  take  a  xanax  or  something
__label__a Seriously  though  who  on  this  site  delivers  Xanax?
__label__a time  to  take  this  vyvanse  and  be  productive  as  shit  at  work  for  no  reason  because  its  wednesday  and  we'll  be  dead  as  shit.
__label__m i  had  a  dream  last  night  that  someone  tried  selling  me  xanax  and  i  punched  them  in  the  face.  haha  fuck  xanax
__label__a Hydrocodone  pills  will  help  you  hallucinate  before  you  go  robbed  so  I'm  chillin  hella  hard  😂

__label__m yung  jean  in  the  club  for  some  morphine
__label__m have  an  extra  toe?you  probably  have  anorexia.this  causes  masturbation.try  abilify
__label__a my  brother  gets  the  strongest  prescription  adderall  and  xanax,  hmu
__label__m That  taylor  swift’s  article  worote  by  eliza  thompson  is  just  the  fucking  worst  article  i  have  read  in  my  entire  life.  What  a  jealous  cunt  losing  her  time  writing  on  taylor’s  feud  with  her  fucking  leg  wtf  is  she  okay?  Take  some  xanax  honey,  you  need  it
__label__c _U  Hungry    cause  of  this  hydrocodone  but  I’m  good  otherwise!  How  are  you
__label__c Had  a  wonderful  morphine/vomit  experience  earlier.  And  between  the  hospital  activity  and  stressing  about  John,  I  have  hardly  slept.  I  feel  like  a  hollowed  out  husk  of  a  person  right  now.  If  anyone  has  a  few  spare  prayers  in  their  back  pocket,  we  could  sure  use  them.
__label__c I  fill  my  brain  with  lorazepam.
__label__m _U  ‘s  called  Xanax
__label__m Look  at  what  #STIU  at  Guadalupe  County  Correctional  Facility  discovered  trying  to  get  by  in  the  mail…suboxone!  #Busted  #notonourwatch  #GCCF  #NMCD
__label__m but  what  is  fake  xanax  made  out  of?  it's  a  fucking  prescription  pill.  what  the  fuck  is  wrong  with  people...
__label__m Moreover,  there  was  a  different  event  in  2010,  when  the  mortality  uptick  starts,  that  fits  the  data  better:  reformulation  of  oxycontin
__label__m _U  i  saw  you  take  that  adderall  before  the  games
__label__u lyrica  is  so  freaking  gorgeous.  like  absolutely  stunning.  i  love  how  a1  respects  her.  he’s  never  done  no  shady  shit    for  tv  #LHHHReunion
__label__c ...4  hours  and  0.5mg  of  ativan  every  two  hours.  i  feel  absolutely  helpless.  and  i  hate  it.
__label__c _U  one  night  while  stopping  seroquel,  I  took  ambien,  klonopin,  trazodone,  and  benadryl  and  couldn't  fucking  sleep
__label__u I  did  not  know  Lyrica  was  about  that  life.  I'm  kind  of  proud  of  ol  girl.  #LHHH
__label__c _U  I  saw  an  orthopedic  surgeon  in  Houston.  She  wanted  me  to  talk  to  a  psychologist,  do  water  exercise,  and  take  an  antidepressant  and  a  muscle  relaxer.  She  said  for  anything,  even  tramadol,  I’d  have  to  see  a  rheumatologist.  I  go  to  the  rheumatologist,  I  tell  him  about  my  pain.
__label__m _U  ohhhh  yeah  👍  throw  in  2  sister's    and  it's  diazepam  time  .
__label__m _U  she  tells  me  to  take  a  diazepam
__label__m _U  If  you  try  mixing  whisky  and  diazepam  -  it's  more  likely  to  be  Work/Death  Balance
__label__c _U  _U  _U  I  have  children.  I  don't  get  to  sleep.  And  tramadol  has  never  worked  for  me.  Diazepam  is  better.
__label__m ask  your  doctor  about  lyrica
__label__m _U  _U  Ms.  Brandt  suggested  step  therapy  and  prior  authorization.  Part  “D”  plans  use  these  as  cost-saving  tools.  Why  jump  through  hoops  for  expensive  Lyrica  when  hydromorphone  costs  $7/fill?
__label__a sip  some  lean  pop  a  xanax  bar  💭
__label__m _U  Just  how  much  Ativan  did  you  give  your  camera?
__label__a adderall  and  preworkout.  wow...just  wow
__label__c it's  all  well  and  good  doctors  prescribing  morphine  and  sending  me  home  but  i  want  to  know  what's  still  wrong  with  my  eyes
__label__c _U  i'm  sorry  oh  man  i'm  on  oxycodone  bc  i  got  my  wisdom  teeth  out  i  am  not  in  my  right  mind
__label__c _U  yeah,  i  have  some  seroquel  saved  from  my  last  therapy  session,  but  just  getting  a  doctor  is  super  hard  for  me  at  the  moment      thank  you  for  the  advice  tho
__label__c So  today  at  the  hospital  I  had  to  have  a  doctor  hold  my  mouth  open  with  a  metal  tongue  depressor  and  shove  several  needles  in  my  throat  to  drain  three  peritonsillar  abscess...  it  was  traumatizing.  But  I  love  morphine  so  yay.
__label__c I  wish  there  was  a  drug  just  like  adderall  that  didn't  make  me  want  to  kill  myself  every  time  I  took  it.  Back  to  OMing.
__label__u _U  Prince  Valium  is  avaliable
__label__m so  thankful  my  vet  knows  my  dog  and  i  need  valium  for  road  trips
__label__m _U  _U    _U    _U  _U    Wonder  how  much  adivan,  cymbalta,  prozac,  abilify,  ritalin  etc.,  has  been  prescribed  since  Trump  took  office?  Just  curious...😊
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  oh,  we  called  valium  that.
__label__c okay  i  need  a  xanax  and  a  cup  of  tea
__label__c took  a  vyvanse  today  for  the  first  time  an  quite  a  little  while,  and  damn,  it  sucks  ass
__label__m _U  Hooray!  And  what  happens  if  &  when  the  cancer  is  gone.  A  tsunami  withdrawal  compared  with  Morphine  or  similar  PKs.
__label__a _U  Omg  I  want  tramadol  lol  post  it  to  me  xxx
__label__m give  me  another  valium,  give  me  another  hr  or  two,  hour  w/  you!  😵
__label__m "marketing  succeeded  in  ways  that  astonished  even  purdue  executives.  oxycontin  didn’t  just  replace  ms  contin  revenues.  it  dwarfed  them."
__label__m put  on  a  patek  pop  a  xanax  im  and  addict  !!
__label__m how  do  people  focus  and  actually  listen  to  teachers  talk  about  stuff  they  aren't  interested  in  without  adderall
__label__c _U  _U  I've  been  prescribed  Valium  after  an  injury,  too.  All  it  made  me  was  sleepy.
__label__a alcohol  and  vyvanse  is  one  hell  of  a  mixture
__label__c _U  it  probably  won't  work  on  you.  seroquel  and  valium  knock  me  out.  benadryl  works,  but  it  comes  with  side  effects.
__label__m Has  Mike  Dean  had  a  pre  game  diazepam?  Could  have  sent  two  players  off.    #BOUMCI
__label__c _U  As  a  Chronic  pain  patient  I  am  FORCED  to  take  methadone,  Vicodin  10mg  and  valium  because  of  extremely  uninformed  "doctors"  like  this.  And  we  wonder  why  there's  an  opioid  crisis.  GET  A  CLUE.....plant  vs.  chemical...hmmmm
__label__m expand  prescribing  of  buprenorphine  for  opioid  abuse?  experts  weigh  pros  and  cons  -  buprenorphine  is  a  critical  part  of  treatment  for  the  g…

__label__m _U  _U  _U      may  lorazepam  sprinkles  yan,  in  rainbow  colors  pa    #aldubmaymagbabalik
__label__m new  study  argues  that  if  you  put  adderall  in  the  water  at  cambridge,  there  won't  be  anybody  left  to  lecture  at  mit.
__label__c _U  suboxone  is  the  devil  .  it's  harder  to  get  off  than  actual  opiates  .
__label__m I  may  need  to  ship  in  adderall  before  year  13  starts  unless  motivation  levels  are  📈
__label__c _U  _U  **screams**  pls  don't  forget  the  xanax  for  me.
__label__a i  literally  see  myself  having  mental  breakdowns  being  high  off  valium  &  dancing  with  my  children  to  2005  hyphy  music
__label__m _U  before  you  take  buprenorphine  you  have  be  clean  for  3  days  or  you  go  in  to  what's  called  a  super  withdrawal.  docs  should've  known  this
__label__c bad  news:  dentist    good  news:  valium    *i'm  not  responsible  for  my  tweets  for  most  of  today.
__label__c Well,  after  four  good  days  I  had  a  major  sad-angry  this  morning  &  was  an  arsehole  at  work,  even  after  taking  Valium.  Fuck  all  of  the  things.
__label__m thankful  for  you  guessed  it  xanax
__label__m _U  do  you  guys  need  food  drinks  alchoal  xanax  ???  😂😂😂😂😂
__label__m One  of  my  irls  is  saying  how  much  she  loves  frank  and  the  ‘Frankie  say  Xanax’  t  shirt  not  knowing  the  full  story  she’s  cancelled
__label__c of  course  when  i  forget  to  take  my  vyvanse  it's  the  busiest  and  most  stressful  day  of  work.
__label__m Trump's  slurred  speech:  Seroquel  dosage  too  high!
__label__m Height  of  Thanksgiving  Break:  about  to  Aeropress  some  Hydrocodone.
__label__a _U  Amen  I  just  took  another  Xanax.  Gawd
__label__c Valium  suppresses  it  marijuana  releases  it...  I  unable  to  give  up  tobacco  because  of  medication  also
__label__c half  dose  of  my  seroquel  really  doesn’t  make  me  sleepy
__label__a took  too  much  ativan  oops
__label__m Have  an  aversion  to  tight  spaces?Yes?You  suffer  from  Trichotillomania.This  causes  bellybutton  growth.Try  Methadone
__label__c the  tramadol  i  take  for  these  cramps  is  gonna  set  my  life  so  right  when  i  get  home.  accompanied  by  the  chocolate  and  the  nap.
__label__m _U  a  klonapin  or  half  a  valium  calm  down  lady
__label__a just  made  some  hydrocodone  ,does  it  work  for  every  time  i  got  curved  in  the  moment  a  guy  talks  bad  about  a  girl  all  hell  breaks  loose.
__label__m greys  -  adderall
__label__a _U  And  this  is  why  we  are  twitter  friends.  ❤️my  inbox  is  open  too.  I  would  be  eating  my  feelings  too..with  a  side  of  #ativan
__label__c maybe  taking  another  vyvanse  at  5pm  was  a  bad  idea  cause  i'm  still  wide  awake  and  its  5am
__label__c _U  oh  i  won't  share  my  morphine  then
__label__m _U  Seems  you  have  been  throwing  rocks  at  sane  people  like  Rehab  Rush  has  been  doing  for  years.  Are  you  addicted  to    OxyContin  to  keep  you  up  like  he  does  or  are  you  on  a  stronger  drugs.
__label__c first:100  mg  of  neurontin  3x  a  day,  1  mg  haldol  2x  a  day,  0.1  mg  of  clonidine  2x  a  day,  20  mg  of  zyprex  zydis  at  night,  2  mg  of  ativan-night
__label__c _U  I  should’ve  just  took  a  hydrocodone  but  it’s  too  late  I  can’t  add  it  on  top  of  the  ibuprofen
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  Morphine  sucks,  only  gave  me  a  headache!!
__label__m _U  Masa  this  guy  Police  should  arrest  him..He’s  taking  Tramadol  then  things  ...S3  He’s  good  than  Messi  &  Ronaldo...Archi  Goro  self  Dey  ball  pass  am.  Ahye  me  paaaa  😂
__label__a waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay  too  much  codeine  and  adderall
__label__m Gabapentin  can  be  Repaired      Memories  can  be  recovered  life  can  be  returned  to  normal.    _U  has  heard  this  explanation  from  me.    A  very  low  dose  of  Strattera  25  mg  when  flashbacks  are  not  present    more  than  25  mg  will  cause  an  overwhelming  recovery  of  memory.
__label__m _U  adderall  not  for  anxiety  lol.  xanax  are  lol
__label__m when  will  people  realize  that  some  people  take  xanax  for  actual  reasons  like  uh  i  dunno  anxiety
__label__c for  some  reason  i  had  an  adderall  in  my  pm  pills  box  so  that’s  kicking  in  with  all  of  my  sleep  meds  and  now  i  feel  like  a  dvd  player
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  When  I  see  he’s  on  a  show  I  turn  it  off.    He’s  a  worthless  crank  with  a  new  calm  approach  due  to  a  YUGE  dose  of  meds.  CLONIPIN,  VALIUM,  ZOLOFT  all  at  once.
__label__m No  wonder  you  take  all  the  drugs  going,  phoning  up  ex  colleagues  begging  for  Valium.  I  would  to,  if  I  was  as  defective  as  you.  Least  I’ve  got  two  beautiful  kids,  more  than  you’ll  ever  have  😂
__label__m _U  _U  Because  not  everybody  has  a  support  system  or  a  therapist  that  cares  enough  that  they  can  call  them  at  1:38  in  the  morning  when  they're  being  tormented  to  the  point  where  they  want  to  take  a  shot  of  Klonopin  and  Fireball  but  luckily  I  do  have  people  that  give  a  damn.
__label__u Cancel  Lyrica  &  this  whole  storyline.
__label__a bored  af  xanax  down  the  hatch
__label__m ugggh  tastes  like  shake  and  stems  god!  i  can't  even  hit  it  aaaaaah  my  body  i'm  so  scared  no  i  don't  want  to  go  to  er  no  valium
__label__a i  miss  dxm  and  adderall  in  my  system  24/7  but  i  know  my  bodies  better  without  it
__label__m gimme  n  flip  experience  oxycontin  where  -  blaze  real
__label__m i've  said  it  before  i'll  say  it  again  and  again.  XANAX.  WILL  .  RUIN.  YOU.  #fuckxans  .  if  they  don't  kill  you,  they  will  change  you.
__label__m _U  My  sister  absolutely  hates  flying,  but  likes  to  travel  a  bit  so  she  bites  the  bullet  with  some  help  from  some  Diazepam😅hope  that  helps!
__label__c _U  I'm  almost  out  of  Tramadol,  out  of  refills,  across  state  lines,  without  my  car  (I  got  a  ride  here).  Waiting  for  a  call  from  the  Dr  to  see  what's  up.  Already  trying  to  extend  what  I  have  left  4  an  add't'l  week  til  I  can  get  home.
__label__m _U  Sorry  to  hear  about  your  bad  day  _U.    Ibuprofen,  Oxycodone  and  Diphenhydramine  for  the  sting.    Hope  you  feel  better!
__label__m _U  I  need  a  Xanax  and  kittens
__label__m adderall  is  tricky  cuz  you  never  know  if  it's  gonna  help  you  solve  heteroskedasticity  in  your  regression  model  or  make  a  mad  chicken  burrito
__label__m _U  not  zolpidem  bc  it  isnt  an  anxiolytic.  probably  more  like  lorazepam.
__label__c Klonopin  instantly  relieves  my  anxiety.  I  should've  insisted.  I'm  not  going  to  let  myself  be  pushed  around  anymore.
__label__m Mrs  Employee  doing  better.  😿🤞🏽Avoiding  surgery  on  colon  perf  &  hope  to  heal  it  enough  to  come  back  to  a  surgery  in  2  months.  Couple  days  more  in  hospital  to  be  "safe."    Hopefully  off  the  morphine  soon.  Getting  tired  of  doing  that  Once  Upon  Time  in  American  puppet  show  for  her.
__label__m _U  It  may  be  that  our  complaints  are  usuaææy  bollocks  though  :)      "I  didn't  get  pain  relief,  you  treated  me  like  an  animal"    Reply  "  you  were  seen  by  a  triage  nurse,  taken  to  a  cubicle  and  given  IV  paracetamol  and  morphine.".
__label__m _U  Try  less  Adderall  and  Caffiene
__label__c oxycodone  is  a  wonderful  pain  medication  lmao.  #thanksdoc
__label__m mom  dying  of  cancer,  how  much  did  the  morphine  help?  it  seemed  to  at  times  make  it  worse.  :-(
__label__m _U  Congrats  on  re-signing  Methadone  Mick.  Surely  you’ve  nabbed  Colgate  as  sponsors?
__label__a _U  buprenorphine  is  my  current  opioid  of  choice  ...  i  recommend  it  highly  because  lets  face  it  everybody's  terminal
__label__m Now  the  President  is  floating  the  idea  of  executing  drug  dealers?  Mr  Trump,  these  are  wealthy  (mostly  Republican)  pharmaceutical  executives  living  comfortable  lives  in  beautiful  homes,  it's  not  right  to  march  them  to  the  gallows  and  hang  them.    #MAGA    #Drugs  #OxyContin
__label__c I  haven't  had  many  dreams  since  getting  to  the  hospital  on  Wednesday  (apparently  mono  and  morphine  do  that  sometimes),  but  I  did  last  night.  All  I  remember  is,  Tom  Jones  is  mad  at  me.  I'm  devastated.
__label__a just  popped  this  adderall  boutta  be  up  forever  😳😳  _U
__label__m q1:  heroin  is  the  brand  name  of  morphine  once  marketed  by  which  pharmaceutical  company?
__label__m _U  _U  _U  How  did  you  want  to  fight  the  epidemic?  More  rehabs?  they  don't  work.  Meetings  not  a  good  idea  either?  Methadone  and  Suboxone  are  no  good  and  sold  on  the  streets...  Vivitrol  injections  and  Naltrexone  implants  are  what  you  have  left  that  is  working.
__label__c _U  _U  It  was  for  me  in  the  second  day  after  the  morphine  wore  off.  You  can  handle  it,  just  try  find  something  to  take  your  mind  off  of  it.
__label__m the  focus  of  the  group  is  taking  adderall  w/o  a  prescription.  claims  is  a  gateway  drug  which  does  not  improve  ability  to  study.  #citizenbear
__label__c Seroquil  puts  u  out  and  I  shit  u  not  I  literally  had  like  5  different  dreams  no  mlk  #drugs

__label__m i  needa  ask  my  doctor  for  a  xanax  prescription
__label__u Lyrica:  Of  so  you're  gonna  beat  my  ass?  Moniece:  THATS  JUST  WTF  WE  GOTTA  DO!    Lmao  I  like  Moniece  this  season.  #LHHH

__label__c _U  i  took  valium  but  i'd  need  a  valium  the  size  of  an  orange  for  me  to  actually  feel  it
__label__m _U  Loving  some  Europe?  I  hope  you  guys  have  a  great  time.  You  should  have  gotten  some  Xanax  bars  for  your  flight.  Just  6  would  do.
__label__m i  shit  you  not  im  lying  watching  tv  and  it’s  not  even  9pm  yet  and  a  LYRICA  advert  comes  on  ...  what  even  is  life

__label__a _U  slams  a  tramadol  right  in  your  hands  and  then  knocks  one  back  myself
__label__c isn't  adderall  supposed  to  make  me  not  hungry.....  #emaciated
__label__a I  just  found  an  entire  bottle  of  oxycodone  from  my  last  crash,  score!
__label__m _U  If  you  wrestle  your  dog  into  that  monstrosity,  you'll  both  need  xanax.  Your  dog  will  also  lose  sleep  plotting  your  demise.
__label__c Goddess  be  a  lyrica  and  deep  tissue  massage  #FibromyalgiaSucks

__label__c my  doctor  prescribed  me  tramadol  to  take  to  cabo.  i'm  dead
__label__c Bear  managed  to  knee  my  in  or  around  my  sciatic  nerve  three  times  yesterday.  I  didn't  want  to  take  gabapentin  at  bedtime  because  of  my  interview  this  morning.  Now  I'm  tired  and  in  pain.
__label__c Theres  nothing    ativan  and  a  quick  nap  cant  fix
__label__c I  am  so  thankful  for  adderall.  It's  like  a  "wipe-away-the-depression-and-ADHD-and-do-your-damn-chores"  free  pass  that  I  get  to  take  every  day
__label__a my  time  hop  has  been  filled  with  xanax  lately  lmfao
__label__c amazing  weekend  with  my  favourite  people  but  paying  for  it  with  my  back  today.  let's  hope  the  tramadol  kicks  in  soon
__label__m Liability  protection  from  worst  case  scenarios.  What  when  the  methadone  client  turns  up  dead  with  benzos  and  alcohol  in  his  system?  How  do  you  show  preventive  interventions  around  that  if  you  didn't  know  it  was  happening?  Not  supporting  this,  btw,  I've  miserably  done  100s  of  UDS.
__label__a _U  _U  _U    too  much  quetiapine  makes  me  like  a  leary  drunk  anyway!  #lol
__label__m _U  2-And  he  has  interests  (  money)  in  Suboxone  and  Treatment  Centers  so  he's  lining  his  pockets  with  blood  money!
__label__m _U  _U  Rewatch  altered  carbon  as  a  visual  methadone  treatment.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Oh  yes.  That's  all  thanks  to  Wilson  Hey  on  the  Mountain  Rescue  Committee  in  1949  challenging  the  Home  Office  to  prosecute  him.  Law  changed  in  1950  to  allow  MR  to  have  legal  access  to  morphine.  Stands  to  this  day,  with  a  tweak  to  reduce  bureaucracy  in  2007.
__label__m gabapentin  types  of  morning
__label__m _U  they’re  on  14  xanax
__label__m any  of  yall  take  adderall  i  have  a  question  and  i  can't  find  the  answer  on  the  googs
__label__m Zubzolv/Suboxone  is  the  worst  possible  idea  to  put  in  your  body.  It  can  work  wonders  initially  but    dont  let  docs  put  you  on  it  long  term.
__label__c _U      lyrica  didn't  help.  i  have  effexor  flexeril  and  ativan.  they  said  tylenol  arthritis.  lol.  that's  nothing!    💜💜
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Yes!  I  have  been  hard-pressed  to  find  good  data  on  Bupe  and  Methadone  related  ED  visits.  It’s  hard  to  find  and  what  is  found  looks  massaged  and  minimized.  Also,  methadone  deaths  are  typically  described  as  related  to  pain  not  addiction.
__label__a adderall  &  all  nighters
__label__m meet  me  in  the  hallway..  I  just  left  the  bedroom..  give  me  some  morphine..  is  there  any  more  to  do  ?    (amo  essa,  socorro)
__label__m _U  Risperdal  was  suggested  by  Americans  to  us  as  we  had  brought  down  the  market  drastically.

(not  complaining  about  the  valium,  either.)
__label__m i  want  a  boo  that's  the  human  form  of  xanax
__label__a _U  I  literally  stared  at  my  bottle  of  ativan  and  my  bottle  of  wine  for  like  15  minutes  trying  to  decide  which  way  to  go.  That's  how  nuts  this  day  was.
__label__m This  bitch  is  really  obsessed  with  me;  xanax  can  truly  make  you  delusional  kids  don't  do  it  😂
__label__a I  am  so  pissed  off  at  this  pure  ignorant  fool  I  gotta  get  the  fuck  off  twitter  early  tonight.  Its  up  to  the  Democrats?  Hahahahahahaha  God  whata  dumb  Dotard  _U  is  hahahahahaha  I'm  goin  insane!  Someone  hand  me  a  valium  and    BONG!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  😂😂  Bless  your  heart.  You're  gonna  need  some  Xanax  in  the  following  months,  sweetie.  Reality  is  hard.
__label__m risperdal  or  feed
__label__m _U  _U  That  is,  "methadone  for  the  jonesing  Russia  collusion  addicts"  is  a  nice  turn  of  phrase.
__label__m This  ocelot  needs  Oxycontin!
__label__m _U  Got  to  watch  it  there,  Cory  Booker  and  Big  Pharma  don't  want  people  to  know  that  Adderall  and  other  meds  are  to  blame,
__label__m _U      xanax  trump  speaking  about  things  he  knows  nothing  abt...where  was  he  when  his  dead  brothers  child  needed  health  ins.  dumped.
__label__a Not  addicted  to  adderall  anymore  but  I’m  still  addicted  to  porn
__label__m my  18  year  old  cousin  is  out  here  posting  a  little  pile  of  xanax  on  her  snap  story  like  girl  stop
__label__m Evan  Peters  was  like  yeah,  no  make  up,  give  me  that  near  neckband  look  &  a  diet  of  code  red  Mt  dew,  pizza  rolls  &  Adderall  #AHSCult
__label__m _U  .........how  about  Addarall?
__label__m _U  needs  to  show  their  viewers  a  step  by  step  how  to  buy  Xanax  on  DNMs  after  that  $XRP  shill
__label__m i'm  hoping  that  rob  doesn't  give  her  the  diazepam.  but  why  would  she  take  it  otherwise??
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  If  one  person  could  tie  the  lobbyists  to  the  suboxone  and  that  other  thing  they  are  pushing  instead  of  medication  that  works,  that  would  be  big.  It  takes  time  and  research.  If  there  are  folks  bed  &  couch  ridden  that  are  able  to  it  would  uncover  the  true  motive.
__label__c im  sorrt  im  probably  not  making  sense  im  like  tired  as  heckers  ans  i  took  a  combo  of  a  xanax  and  an  ibuprofen  so  i  cant  see  that  well
__label__m _U  I  laugh  go  enter  bush.  Start  talking  about  tramadol  since  you  left  nothing  for  the  Youth.
__label__m _U  I  understand  that  just  know  I'm  not  promoting  Xanax
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  Walmart  is  putting  rules  on  opids  they  only  will  give  a  seven  day  supply  so  how  can  seven  days  of  hydrocodone  serve  me  with  bone  cancer.  Should  I  like  the  republicans  said  take  aspirn  or  suck  it  up.
__label__c Looks  like  another  night  getting  no  sleep.  Need  valium  really  but  there's  no  chance  of  getting  that  from  the  doctors.
__label__a can't  focus  on  studying  to  save  my  life  sos  need  adderall
__label__c _U  seroquel  and    clomiphene  had  me  on  some  loopy  shit  yesterday.  i  don't  remember  anything
__label__m _U  _U  Semi  automatic  pistols  just  because  they  have  a  magazine?  Someone  give  that  guy  more  valium.
__label__c *watching  Gone  Girl*  "I  should've  taken  a  xanax  before  we  watched  this"
__label__c Took  less  Xanax  last  night,  feel  pretty  good  this  morning  #supermorningwood
__label__a _U  i'm  too  gone  off  that  valium  right  nooow.  :/
__label__m My  favorite  thing  about  the  UP  is  all  of  the  teenage  white  boys  who  sniff  Ritalin  2x  a  day  and  eat  neurontin  like  candy  and  have  DUIs  think  that  addiction  is  a  choice  lmfao      “I  choose  abuse  but  not  to  get  addicted”
__label__m _U  you  need  vyvanse  lmao  ritalin  is  for  mild  shit  lol
__label__a drink  some  coffee  to  wake  up  have  a  beer  to  undo  the  effects  of  the  coffee  pop  a  xanax  to  try  and  feel  the  way  u  did  before  coffee
__label__m _U  lmao  i  need  adderall  that's  what  i  need  to  be  exact
__label__m _U  In  other  news:  Christmas  window  dresser  takes  too  much  Tramadol.
__label__c _U  Glad  to  hear  you  discuss  your  situation.  I  am  also  on  Suboxone,  and  if  used  properly,  is  A  life  saver/changer.  It  has  been  A  major  tool  in  my  recovery  of  long  term  opioid  abuse.  Thanks  for  bringing  positive  awareness  to  addiction  and  recovery  👊

__label__a i  just  want  to  take  this  adderall  and  fuck  the  💩  out  of  u
__label__m _U  _U  Methadone  is  not  a  'fix'.  They  are  not  in  withdrawal  between  doses.  They  feel  normal  24/24  on  the  right  dose.
__label__m haha,  adderall  high  probably  not  the  same  as  what  you  are  referring  to,  go  back  about  18  months  and  read  the  following  6  months  :)  _U
__label__m _U  Looks  like  Xanax  for  Xavier.
__label__m _U    mt  _U:  i've  asked  this  before  but  can't  remember.  sominex  when  on  duloxetine  &  pregabalin.  okay  or  not?
__label__c i  hate  regular  seroquel  but...i  can't  really  be  picky  when  i'm  like  this.
__label__c You  get  about  half  an  hour  into  the  hydrocodone  and  it’s  just  🎶”ALL  EYES  ON  ME  IN  THE  CENTER  OF  THE  RING  JUST  LIKE  A  CI~IRCUUUUUS”🎶
__label__a All  this  fake  love  got  me  damaged.  Just  popped  another  Xanax
__label__c prescribed  suboxone  and  klonopin
__label__c Have  you  got  any  pain  Paddy?    Not  since  the  morphine  kicked  in.    #999WhatsYourEmergency

__label__m _U  _U  lmao  she  said  morphe  not  morphine  😂😂😂
__label__a when  you  are  on  adderall  and  the  clase  wont  shut  the  fuck  up
__label__m i  can't  beleive  you  got  banned  from  the  hospital  like  what  if  you  get  sick  and  need  morphine
__label__m _U  you  sounded  like  you  were  on  lorazepam  shuts  you  right  up  well  if  in  psychosis  or  passion
__label__a Who  can  get  me  OxyContin?
__label__a my  shrink  says  i  got  add,  maybe  that  explains  it  all.  still  can't  even  sit  straight,  took  all  of  these  adderall  _U  #lucy
__label__m @paroxysmatic  seroquel  and  lexapro  combo  but  not  including  xanax.  hmm.
__label__m Please  never  take  Xanax,  Lean  or  anything  related.  Another  life  taken  because  of  this.  I’m  devastated.  _U  I  love  you
__label__u #LHHH  Lyrica  needs  a  new  hair  style
__label__m _U  Healthier  to  take  a  Xanax  for  fear  of  flying.
__label__u A1’s  face  when  Lyrica  told  Ray  “imma  get  A1  to  beat  your  mfkn  ass”  😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣  r  u  dumb,  my  man  could  never  😩😂😂
__label__c just  woke  up  after  taking  a  tramadol  for  dinner
__label__c morphine  itching  my  nose  like  a  maniac
__label__a What's  fucked  up  about  college  is  that  Adderall  turns  into  a  goddamn  multivitamin
__label__a 'i  see  ur  12  xanax  and  ill  raise  u  my  half  a  xanax'  'ill  take  ur  half  a  xanax  and  my  12  xanax'
__label__c _U  _U  How  do  you  tell  your  doctor  you’re  having  suicidal  thoughts  w/out  sounding  like  you’re  not  being  compliant?  But,  I  really  am  after  lyrica.  I  think  she’ll  blame  the  opiates  tho’....😡
__label__c _U  yeah  same.  but  i  have  my  xanax  now  for  when  my  nerves  get  bad  so  i  don't  really  stress  out  like  i  use  to🙌🏼
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  I  got  off  that  Merry-Go-Round  pretty  quickly.  I  was  so  agitated  that  I  had  to  take  a  Xanax  and  then  a  nap.  There's  no  reason  for  her  behavior.  Thinking  she's  mrs.  Superior  that  knows  it  all.
__label__m _U  I  still  thought  he  was  drunk  or  was  on  Xanax
__label__m _U  haha  not  wasting  my  day  arguing  with  a  girl  looking  for  xanax  on  her  timeline,  have  a  good  day  :-)
__label__c _U  Think  the  methadone  is  working  😀
__label__m _U  *done  Hospital  bed  with  various  tubes  and  wires  attached  to  him.  Some  giving  him  morphine,  some  removing  waist.
__label__m He  OD’d  on  Xanax.
__label__m _U  “Amen.”    She  exclaimed  with  a  small  laugh  before  her  orbs  scanned  over  the  various  drugs.  Grabbing  four  xanax  tabs  between  acrylic  nails  she  popped  them  into  her  mouth,  swallowing  them  with  the  nearest  bottle  of  alcohol.
__label__m There's  now  only  a  season  between  me  and  Journey's  End.  I  better  stock  up  on  morphine.
__label__m _U  _U  A.  It  is  a  joke.  B.  Take  a  Xanax  so  you  can  C.  Relax.
__label__a _U  I  lost  my  son  my  ex  took  to  much  xanax  and  killed  my  kid

__label__c *waits  for  adderall  to  take  affect*
__label__c _U  Wado,  My  Sister!  And  the  gabapentin!  I  will  do  that‼️
__label__m niggas  on  my  bus  talking  bout  how  they  took  adderall  and  stronger  drugs  to  make  it  through  college.  wtf.
__label__c compared  to  vyvanse,  adderall  (immediate  release)  makes  me  feel  like...  an  exasperated  businesswoman.
__label__m now  understand  why  tramadol  is  nkt  given  otc  without  prescription..  #ecstasy
__label__a this  finna  be  a  long  as  night  and  day  tomorrow  .  im  have  to  pop  2  vyvanse
__label__a i'm  prescribing  400mg  of  seroquel  to  everyone  in  mtl.  rt  _U:  _U  totally  :)
__label__a _U  //Can  someone  bring  me  a  Valium  and  a  Dr.  Pepper?
__label__c _U  _U  The  only  thing  Seroquel  did  for  me  was  make  me  fat!  😂
__label__m _U  tramadol  is  poor  for  the  type  of  pain  we  have.  other  opiates  are  far  better.  synergy  with  paracetamol  &  caffeine  helps  too.
__label__m _U  He  needs  to  grow  the  F  up  and  stop  snorting  his  Adderall.  His  brain  must  look  like  Swiss  cheese.
__label__c _U  I  take  125mg  at  night.      It  has  worked  wonders  on  my  anxiety.          I  have  been  on  it  for  6  months  now.      Before  I  was  on  Olanzapine  and  that  gave  me  pains  in  my  head  when  I  tried  to  think.  I  lost  my  memory,  could  not  remember  anything  !!!
__label__m 😂😂😂  yooo  I  was  crying  at  work  when  Katt  was  talking  about  taking  Tramadol  and  percs  together.
__label__m _U  #meditationwithmsg  helps  in  deaddiction..  even  those  using  60  injections  of  morphine  in  one  day  have  successfully  quit  !!
__label__m i  had  so  many  people  come  up  to  me  at  the  bars  last  night  and  brag  about  being  on  adderall  i  thought  i  was  at  a  freshman  welcome  week  party
__label__m _U  Lmao  sure,  I'm  prescribing  you  some  adderall
__label__c i  hate  taking  Ativan  even  when  necessary  because  I'll  go  through  withdrawal  for  up  to  2  months.  I've  had  a  severe  vitamin  D  deficiency  for  almost  6  years  and  probably  low  serotonin.    I'm  talking  to  my  doctor  about  this  too  but  if  you  have  similar  experiences  then  uh  let  me  know
__label__a ive  been  up  three  days  adderall  and  red  bull  this  calls  a  mistake  something  strongs  in  this  water  bottle
__label__m (Mental)  ENERGY  is  conserved  within  a  closed  system  unless  acted    upon  by  an  external  force  (adderall)
__label__a somebody  spit  me  some  adderall  for  this  test  in  the  morning
__label__a need  a  fuckin  adderall
__label__m Too  low  for  withdrawal  relief  or  for  full  clinical  effect  (cravings,  blocking)?  I  think  can  vary  by  patient.  Just  anecdote,  but  I  had  patient  tell  me  yesterday  that  bag  almost  always  takes  away  withdrawal,  but  more  bags  needed  to  feel  comfortable.  I  think  similar  with  methadone.
__label__m halsey:  i'm  gonna  stage  dive!    sheppard:  i  need  a  xanax

__label__m _U  whats  your  opinion  on  adderall  for  tests?  is  it  addicting?  any  downsides?
__label__m _U  _U  Investigate  drugs  like  diazepam.  So  many  mass  shooters  are  on  SSRI’s.  There’s  a  connection  for  sure.

__label__c Xanax  makes  my  body  feel  like  it  got  a  beatdown  but  my  mind  experiences  peace  like  never  before.

__label__m _U  _U  use  code  banks  for  5  percent  off  adderall
__label__c My  doctor  called.  We  spoke  about  attachment  &  loss  &  flashbacks  &  panic  attacks.  She’s  done  me  more  Diazepam.  I’m  feeling  drained  now  after  that  phone  call.

__label__a that  boy  ken  off  a  adderall  finna  be  up  all  night  lol
__label__u Lyrica  should  pop  that  mole  off  her  face  !!!
__label__m _U  Look  at  her  she  looks  like  a  Lorazepam.  I  give  her  3  weeks  before  she  quits.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  why  he's  tramadol:  1)  processed  by  different  people  differently,  often  surprisingly  2)  at  first  may  seem  like  a  plausible  alternative  to  traditional  options  given  their  known  downsides,  but  on  closer  analysis  is  both  less  effective  and  has  more  side  effects
__label__u What  does  Lyrica  have  on?  lol.
__label__m for  those  who  didn't  know  the  chemical  alkaline  which  most  basic  for  is  tums  stimulates  adderall  your  welcome  druggies
__label__c oxycodone  after  surgery  is  like  breakfast  in  the  morning.

__label__m Have  an  explosive  temper?Yes?You  suffer  from  BPD.This  causes  numbness.Try  Xanax
__label__m _U  _U  The  drugs  is  not  only  in  the  hands  of  addicts    Even  kids  have  access  to  these  drugs.  I  lost  a  16  year  old  Jss  3  student  recently  to  tramadol  over  dose.  It  is  eating  deep  into  the  society  than  we  think  Even  young  females  indulge  too
__label__m just  popped  to  my  local  pharmacy.  clearly  monday  morning  is  methadone  morning  for  the  rum  sorts  round  here  :uhoh:
__label__m idk  if  xanax  is  cool  or  not  because  i  don't  remember  anything.
__label__m he  apparently  spent  the  duration  of  ts  bonnie  hopped  up  on  xanax  and  waiting  to  die  under  a  computer  desk.
__label__a going  to  pop  some  adderall  😉
__label__m that  cement/adderall  scene  in  Mr  Robot  s2e3  is  fucking  YIKES
__label__m _U  lmao  stax  he  probably  on  some  xanax  talking  about  last  year
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  My  husband  laughed  bitterly  when  hearing  this  plan.  He  was  one  of  those  returning  Viet  Nam  vets  who  had  to  hide  their  former  service.  An  f-ing  PARADE!?!?!?  You  want  to  say  "thank  you"  this  way?!  You  aren't  fooling  anyone,  this  is  valium  for  the  man-baby.
__label__m _U  idek  what  that  means  😂  but  i've  noticed  that  a  few  females  are  psychotic  and  could  probably  use  a  good  dose  of  seroquel
__label__m HEY  it's  XANAX  and  ADDERALL  not  xanex/xaneks/zanax  or  aderol.  I  had  to  say  something  this  shit  was  making  me  want  to  jump  off  a  cliff

__label__c Quetiapine  is  so  funny  bc  I  can  hear  people  talking  to  me  but  I'm  far  too  paralysed  to  reply.  Love  it  🤙🏼
__label__m _U  no  one  is  taking  adderall  in  #bb17.  vanessa  takes  strattera  which  is  a  non  stimulant.  even  if,  why  would  it  be  cheating?
__label__m how  long  does  adderall  stay  in  your  system?  research  purposes
__label__c _U  I've  taken  Lyrica  in  the  past  and  found  it  only  marginally  helpful.  I'm  probably  eventually  headed  for  a  hip  replacement.
__label__c Tramadol  is  the  only  med  to  ever  relieve  my  pain  Otherwise  Im  hurting  every  minute  of  every  day.  I  have  no  access  to  the  only  med  that  helps
__label__c i  swear  adderall  makes  me  a  much  nicer  person
__label__a I  think  I’ll  just  take  another  Xanax  first
__label__m I  hate  when  my  mom  takes  her  vyvanse  she  finds  something  new  for  me  to  do  before  I  finish  the  other  thing  she  told  me  to  do
__label__c Trying  to  stay  awake  for  someone  when  you’re  taking  tramadol  is  a  hard  hard  thing  to  do
__label__c _U  Yeah...  about  10  years  ago  they  where  going  to  give  me  morphine  i.v  to  carry  round  with  me  (as  that's  what  they'd  give  me  in  hospital  and  it  sorta  worked).    Took  XS  to  take  sick  feeling  away...  and  hay  presto...  all  sorted.
__label__m DMAS  //  Step  Up  the  Morphine  tho
__label__u lyrica  andersons  acoustic  sessions  are  the  best
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Many  people  who  died  of  heroin  overdose  were  initially  prescribed  opioid  painkillers  (e.g.  percoset,  oxycodone).  When  the  Rx  ran  out,  heroin  reduced/prevented  uncomfortable  withdrawal  sx.
__label__m morphine,  yearly  radiation  exposure,  and  ignorance  only  2/3  have  limits
__label__c _U  i've  been  off  the  pregabalin  for  about  a  month  now  but  not  sure  what's  triggering  this  flare-up  of  pain  &  spasticity
__label__a i'm  hungry  for  a  adderall
__label__m _U  I  understand  concerns  about  buprenorphine,  but  I  haven't  heard  of  a  better  option.  Not  perfect,  but  what  we  have,  for  now.

__label__m _U  Is  he  expecting  the  money  from  the  tramadol  company  or  from  someone's  salary???
__label__c I'm  sorry  but  it's  ridiculous  that  they  say  this  oil  cant  be  legal  coz  it  gets  u  high.I  was  on  diazepam  &  zopiclone  which  is  legal(man  made)  &  made  me  very  high  very  sick.

__label__c _U  Thank  you  4  telling  me  that.  I  think  These  opiate  sub's  r  still  opiates  .It's  scary  now.  Lyrica  was  introduced  to  me  &  no,  just  say  no.  I  am  going  to  try  to  titrate  off.  I'm  feeling  trapped  on  it.  there  seems  to  B  no  W/Ding  from  some  of  these  "NEW"  alternatives!

__label__m T5  I  cannot  speak  for  others  but  TBH  if  I  was  in  extreme  pain  &  close  to  dying  I  would  feel  a  decision  to  give  me  a  morphine  dose  that  was  potentially  lethal  to  be  an  act  of  kindness.  Rather  than  have  the  pain.  However,  I  would  not  want  to  be  got  rid  of–  unnecessarily.    #IrishMed
__label__m Question  for  those  in  recovery  from  #opioids  or  #heroin:  pre-recovery,  did  you  ever  use  suboxone  or  methadone  to  bridge  the  gap  btw  using,  vs  w/  the  intention  to  quit?  If  so,  how  do  you  view  that  experience  now?  Was  it  helpful  or  hurtful  to  your  recovery?  #PWUD  #harmreduction

My  experience  of  pain  relief  in  hospitals  is  they  really  don't  bother  that  much  unless  you've  got  someone  willing  to  holler  about  it  for  you  for  hours.
__label__m _U  drug  dealers  are  white  called  pain  management  centers  in  Florida.    Look  it  up.    People  go  to  Florida  to  [pain  management  centers  and  can  get  prescriptions  all  they  want.    Hell  Rush  Limbaugh  was  caught  at  border  with  2000  oxycontin  pills  on  his  person.  If  I  remember  correctly.
__label__m I  knew  some  dude  who’d  buy  bud  and  would  shove  tramadol  or    bars  up  his  ass  but  he  thought  no  one  knew
__label__c so  the  question  is:  do  i  take  valium  before  the  show  to  calm  my  inevitable  nerves?  :(  #criticalrole
__label__m the  xanax  story  is  the  best  new  in  town  part  change  my  mind
__label__c i  thought  i  was  taking  30mg  of  celexa  but  it  turns  out  it  was  60mg  of  adderall.  classic  _U
__label__m _U  then  take  him  off  morphine  since  it  affects  the  eeg.  #charliegard.  gollop  is  grasping  at  straws.
__label__m _U  _U  huh.  it  sounds  a  little  "pretty  neat",  and  a  little  "someone  let  Scott  McNealy  out  of  his  cage  and  force-fed  him  some  adderall  again".
__label__c #youhaveissueswhen  the  klonopin  stops  working
__label__c "_U:  adderall  had  me  body  slamming  the  first  alligator  to  look  at  me  the  wrong  way"  lmfao  forreal
__label__c _U  Leg  hurts  from  surgery  ,oxycodone  doesn’t  feel  like  it’s  helping  at  all
__label__m The  withdrawals  from  not  having  any  footy  to  watch  tonight  are  that  bad  I've  had  to  resort  to  going  on  FIFA    I  imagine  it's  a  bit  like  methadone  to  a  smackhead  🤔🙈😂  #ornot
__label__a shit  like  this  make  me  wanna  quit  selling  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  John  H  Stewart  of  Emblem  Cannabis,  the  man  responsible  for  OxyContin  via  Purdue  Pharma.
__label__c took  morphine  patch  off  due  to  tachycardia,  anxiety  and  dive  in  mood.
__label__m _U  _U  pop  some  adderall  you'll  be  done  in  5  min
__label__a ugh  i'm  feeling  super  fucking  mean  today  you  guys.  oh  look  i  found  a  xanax  under  the  couch.  nvm.
__label__c spent  12  hours  in  the  hospital  yesterday.  there’s  a  bad  virus  going  around  y’all  be  careful.  painful  stomach  bug.  they  had  to  give  me  morphine  the  pain  was  that  bad..  what  an  experience.
__label__c morphine  has  0  effect  on  my  body,  i'm  like  a  twilight  wolf  ..  they  have  to  give  me  real  ass  drugs  to  even  feel  it
__label__c i  missed  adderall  so  much  i  forgot  about  the  horrible  headaches  it  gives  me  when  it’s  wearing  off  😖
__label__c Also  sometimes  the  caffeine  gives  me  an  anxiety  attack  and  I  end  up  having  to  have  a  lie  down  and  take  half  a  diazepam.
__label__a someone  deliver  me  adderall  or  a  really  smart  person  to  do  my  paper  so  i  can  stop  complaining  tysm
__label__m _U  _U  _U  You're  prescribed  Xanax  for  anxiety  so....
__label__a can  you  get  addicted  to  adderall?  bc  I  lowkey  love  this  feeling  🤭  #crackbaby
__label__m _U  To  be  fair,  if  you're  dying  of  TB  anyway,  it  probably  is  superior  to  morphine.
__label__c _U  aw  aye  hahaha  was  screaming  in  the  middle  of  the  street  man.  just  went  home  and  took  a  cold  and  flu  tablet  thinking  it  was  tramadol  and  fell  asleep  and  woke  up  and  went  to  hospital  the  next  day
__label__m trying  to  drink  enough  coffee  to  convince  myself  i'm  on  adderall
__label__a i  need  coffee  and  ibu...  but  red  bull  adderall  and  vic  would  do  good  too.  lol.  #tiredandsore
__label__a im  just  tryna  sell  my  vyvanse  :////
__label__m vous  jamais  aimé?’  Then  she  gives  way  and  bursts  into  _sanglots_,  and  implores  him  to  believe  her,  and  that  she  adored  him.  He  refuses  to  believe  her  and  goes  out.  Then  all  is  pantomime.  She  takes  up  a  knife,  throws  it  down,  gets  a  little  bottle  of  ‘morphine,’  drinks
__label__m i  been  up  3  days,  adderall  and  red  bull.....except  minus  the  adderall
__label__c _U  yep  it  has  been  fixed.  i  think  morphine  was  playing  some  tricks  on  me.
__label__c well  i  was  gonna  play  fifa  but  the  adderall  decided  that  cleaning  my  room  and  bathroom  is  a  better  idea
__label__m _U  testing  for  adderall  is  also  handled  very  loosely,  I  mean,  not  at  all.
__label__m Brian  killed  him,  otherwise  I  wouldn't  be  able  to  sleep  tonight.  I'm  shaking  like  a  leaf.  I  need  a  Valium  or  something.
__label__m i  envy  people  who  are  able  to  confidently  share  their  work  (art,  writing  etc)  online  without  needing  to  take  a  valium  first.
__label__u Ginny  and  Lyrica  reminds  me  of  DomKat.  I  swear  to  God  why  are  they  doing  this  to  me.
__label__m Interested  in  connecting  with  anyone  who  has  been  prescribed  Oxycodone  by  their  GP  a  powerful  Opiate  pain  killer  which  is  highly  addictive.
__label__m _U  _U  What  is  the  mechanism  of  action  for  #Penthrox  #methoxyflurane  with  regard  to  site  of  action  &  type  of  #receptors  involved,  if  known?      As  far  as  I'm  aware  morphine  has  a  presynaptic  action,  inhibiting  NT  release,  so  does  #Penthrox  have  a  different  #pharmacological  action.
__label__a actually  sick  b2b  stiff  neck  b2b  vyvanse  b2b  ibuprofen  b2b  don  julio
__label__a xanax  is  evil  &  i  swear  i'll  never  touch  that  shit  again.
__label__m _U  _U  lol  guess  she  already  took  the  valium  😂😂
__label__m _U  Oh,  f**k  no....do  they  still  make  Valium?
__label__c _U  I  am  just  going  to  take  some  Valium...
__label__m _U  i  already  said  that  last  night  morphine
__label__a give  me  a  bottle  of  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  xanax  isn't  the  only  pill  lmao
__label__c Okay  mid-morning  anxiety  is  kicking  in  right  on  schedule.  I  think  I  should  ask  my  doctor  for  something  other  than  Ativan.
__label__m It's  shitty  like  I  know  how  it  feels  but  I'm  all  like  do  you  know  how  this  feels:    It  feels  like  fire  and  morphine🔥
__label__m Box  Tops  for  Education  should  cover  Xanax.      There  I  said  it.
__label__a Secured  the  hydrocodone  like  yerrrrp
__label__m _U  Adderall  good.  But  the  comedown  is  a  pain  sometimes
__label__m _U  _U  _U  it  was  all  the  valium  women  were  taking
__label__m ...if  stacey  has  just  started  taking  olanzapine,  i  expect  to  see  her  overweight  in  three  months  time.  perhaps  quetiapine  or  aripriprazole???
__label__c _U  Exactly-  when  the  doctor  put  me  on  lyrica  he  said  if  this  doesn’t  help  then  we  are  coming  down  to  the  end  of  how  we  can  medically  treat  you...  it  didn’t  &  wasn’t  worth  the  cost  or  side  effects.  So  yes,  I  know  &  relate.  Gentle  hugs  🤗  💞
__label__a Finals  Week  Menu:  Adderall  with  espresso  shots  for  chaser
__label__a This  was  too  general  and  “not  to  offend  anyone,  but...”  of  a  tweet  to  work.  I  have  a  very  addictive  personality.  Will  is  a  big  part  of  being  clean.  It’s  why  I  don’t  do  heroin,  meth,  percs  anymore.  I  eat  Xanax  in  .5  mg  doses  and  smoke  bud.  All  it  takes  is  wrong  place  wrong  time
__label__c _U  Oh  shit,  I  managed  to  leave  off  the  best  one!    "We  think  she  took  a  little  too  much  of  her  meth-like  medication  [Vyvanse,  for  the  narcolepsy]"  -  said  by  the  paramedic  to  the  intake  nurse,  as  I  struggled  to  breathe  during  an  anaphylactic  reaction  🙃
__label__c _U  _U  _U  Good  for  u!!  Keep  it  up.  I'm  almost  a  month  off  methadone  after  7.5  yrs!    There's  so  many  of  us  out  here.  Much  love+☮️to  u!!
__label__m _U  Somebody  needs  a  puck  size  valium,  and  it's  not  you  Rick!
__label__m _U  diazepam  /    lorazepam  to  help  you  sleep  perhaps.  sorry  you're  in  pain..
__label__m _U  idk  it's  called  like  gabapentin  or  something  like  that.  😂
__label__c _U  xanax  also  helps.
__label__m What  Blood  cult  heroin  methadone  and  alcohol  not  water  cocaine  with  maple  syrup  is  the  heroin
__label__c Really  regretting  not  filling  my  klonopin  prescription  right  now.
__label__c _U  good  lord,  that  man  is  such  a  putz.  i  think  i  should  take  a  klonopin  to  tamp  down  my  temper  now.
__label__m All  the  originality  got  killed  by  four  lokos  and  Xanax  bars
__label__u Lyrica  still  fucking  with  condoms  ?  #LHHH
__label__m _U  athletes  losing  weight  is  nothing  compared  to  people  on  olanzapine  or  quetiapine  losing  weight.  have  you  done  that?
__label__m _U  _U  is  pushing  MORE  people  back  to  heroin  and  oxycodone  with  this  stupid  move  _U  _U
__label__m want  to  customize  my  own  white  high  top  vans  with  drawn  on  titties  and  xanax  bars
__label__m _U  hulitho  from  philly  wit  tha  xanax  vine???
__label__c morphine  still  got  me  itching....

__label__a Who  got  tramadol  200-225mg  ?
__label__m with  a  side  of  lamictal  rt  @emptychampagne:  my  god  this  woman  needs  to  take  a  few  dozen  milligrams  of  xanax.
__label__m _U  Makes  good  sense.  Got  Trump?  Take  oxycodone.
__label__c _U  beta  blockers,  venlafaxine,  quetiapine  and  the  pill.  i  rattle  lol.
__label__m _U  eatin  on  a  adderall  wash  it  down  with  some  alcohol  writin  holy  mackerel  actual  or  factual
__label__c i  love  adderall  so  much.  instead  of  lying  uselessly  on  the  floor  for  hours  i  cleaned  the  kitchen  and  exercised  a  little  and  \o/
__label__c this  was  a  great  day  to  rediscover  valium
__label__m Have  recurrent  procrastination?Yes?You  suffer  from  Anorexia.This  causes  bones  to  dissolve.Try  Xanax
__label__m _U  His  name  is  little  xanax,  that  should  tell  you  everything  about  this  little  crack  baby
__label__a fucked  off  them  orange  pills  cuz  them  xanax  make  me  nod
__label__c _U  it's  the  hydrocodone  talking
__label__c _U  seroquel  time  is  a  very  dangerous  time
__label__c It  has  been  almost  two  weeks  and  has  been  almost  a  week  since  I  went  to  the  hospital  and  they  said  "it's  just  anxiety/withdrawal"    I've  had  my  Seroquel  back  in  my  system  since  Friday.  I  can  sleep  again  but  still  waking  up  unable  to  breathe  properly  🙃
__label__m #DaylightSavingsTime  change  is  like  surgery.  The  1st  day  is  numb  euphoria  from  the  anesthesia  of  a  successful  operation.  By  the  3rd  day  you're  screaming  for  more  morphine.
__label__m _U  key  logger  punk  likes  adderall  lil  tony
__label__a where  da  mf  tall  cans  at  bitch  where  the  xanax  bars  at  hoe  feed  me  oxycodone
__label__m 2  antidepressants  (fluoxetine  &  mirtazapine),  1  mood  stabiliser  (lamotrigine),  1  atypical  antipsychotic  (aripiprazole),  1  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (atomoxetine)  &  1  amphetamine  (lisdexamfetamine)
__label__m On  my  song  ‘A.OKAY’,  I  used  a  line  that  says  “take  another  xan  I  might  lose  all  control”.  The  truth,  I  ain’t  ever  popped  a  xan.  But  one  is  all  it  would  take.  I’d  prolly  lose  control.  People  are  saying  “end  xanax  2018”  I’m  blessed  I  never  even  started.
__label__u no  matter  what  the  lyrica  are,  the  beat  just  makes  you  feel  good  then  you  got  the  dream  doing  his  two  step  on  it.
__label__c One  time  I  was  locked  out  of  my  phone  for  an  hour  after  my  operation  cause  I  was  putting  in  the  time  instead  of  my  password.  I  love  morphine
__label__a About  to  make  an  appt  to  get  me  sum  tramadol..
__label__c Thanks  to  Valium  and  Taylor  Swift  I  had  a  blast  during  my  MRI
__label__m _U  Hell  no,  alprazolam  and  all  other  benzodiazepines  are  the  worst.  the  relation  between  desirable  neurotransmitters  released  and  negative  side  effects  pale  in  comparison  to  opioids.
__label__m _U  _U  Wow!  Your  ignorance.  NEXT!!!  This  guy’s  beyond  saving  -  give  him  as  much  morphine  as  we  can  spare.  Not  too  much-  lots  of  other  libs  to  ‘treat’
__label__m _U  Idk  you  look  too  healthy  for  morphine  I  don't  see  broken  bones  or  limbs.  Ibuprofen  for  you  🤠  tbh  you  probably  got  infections  with    the  weather  switch  up  fuck  ya  medic
__label__a i'm  pretty  sure  that  all  the  red  bull,  nicotine,  and  adderall  i  put  in  my  body  on  the  daily  are  going  to  make  have  a  heart  attack  1  day  soon

__label__m _U  #alcoholawareness  What  Government  and  media  are  not  talking  about-The  deadliest  drug-Legal  or  not-Alcohol-Thanks  CT  Suboxone
__label__m _U  I’m  sorry  for  the  loss.  Exact  same  death  for  my  mom  &  I  held  her  too.  Only  too  out  from  morphine  to  speak.  Horrible  death.
__label__c like,  a  when  i  was  taking  seroquel  i  was  told  it  would  make  me  tired  but  it  didn't,  same  thing  with  what  i'm  taking  now
__label__m y'all  don't  understand  how  mad  my  mom  was  when  she  found  out  that  my  xo  tattoo  was  for  the  weeknd  &  meant  ecstasy  and  oxycontin  😭😭
__label__m im  gonna  see  if  i  can  get  some  lyrica  too

__label__c _U  No  haven’t  even  researched  meds  I  just  thought  Valium  and  chiropractor  would  help  and  the  former  I  can’t  take  unless  it’s  an  emergency.  Hope  everything  goes  ok  today  keep  me  posted?
__label__m i  am  the  xanax
__label__c The  morphine  isn’t  working  and  I  don’t  understand  why
__label__m Schizophrenia  is  a  life  full  of  misconception,  if  untreated  #abilify  #feelRealLife
__label__c _U  Be  very  careful.  I've  been  taking  my  Xanax  on  and  off  and  taking  more  than  half  a  mg  can  turn  a  lightweight  into  jelly.
__label__m The  nurses  just  told  me  that  morphine  is  a  possibility  today  but  my  doctor  told  me  I  didn’t  need  someone  to  drive  me  so  I’m  here  alone..  well,  shoot.
__label__a note  to  self:  before  every  test  take  adderall  so  you  can  take  a  shit  ton  of  notes  to  study  from
__label__c _U  Mine  was  quite  painful,  to  the  point  I  went  out  in  a  blizzard  and  literally  walked  to  a  walk-in  clinic  where  they  immediately  put  me  on  a  regimen  of  Zostavax.  #helped  Then  it  took  3  months  of  Pregabalin.  😣  Thankfully  it  hasn't  recurred.  (3  years  ago)
__label__m i  don't  get  people  who  speed  on  vyvanse  or  addies  just  to  be  fucked  up.

__label__a where  can  i  get  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  #ChronicPain  yes  all  modalities  including  opioids  not  ,suboxone  ,unless  asked  4,  should  be  a  part  of  patient  treatment  plan.  Why  should  Any  meds  be  stopped/reduced  if  effective?  Including  opioids?  Should  bp  meds  ,  insulin  b  looked  at,  reduced  cuz  some  abuse?
__label__c I  need  to  go  to  the  pharmacy  and  complain  about  this  last  batch  of  Ativan.    It's  like  anti-Ativan
__label__m _U  "I  don't  want  that..."  she  says,  pulling  a  face  at  that  suggestion.  "I'll  just  take  a  normal  painkiller...  You  can  have  morphine  if  you  want."
__label__c _U  i  don't  know  what  it  is  about  sandwiches  and  xanax  lol  i  always  start  makin  one  and  forget  what  i'm  doin  lolol
__label__m _U  _U  I'm  so  sorry!  I  recently  read  a  review  on  a  pain  management  doctor.  The  patient  went  to  him  thinking  he  treated  pain.  After  charging  her  $600  he  offered  suboxone
__label__m _U  My  money  is  on  valium
__label__u Lyrica's  music  isn't  bad  at  all

__label__m xanax  on  my  ass  !
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Actually  there  is  clinical  evidence  that  codeine/hydrocodone  are  cough  suppressants.  But  since  there  are  over  the  counter  cough  suppressants  that  do  the  trick,  it's  unnecessary  unless  we're  talking  whooping  cough.
__label__c thankful  for  his  ecstatic  embraces  in  this  current  morphine  life.

__label__m imagine  being  a  grown  man  taking  xanax  cause  some  16  year  old  rappers  are  doing  it  lollllllll
__label__m He  remains  unemployed  5  years  later  AND  on  welfare  (more  expense  to  the  taxpayer)  -  yes  on  welfare  for  FIVE  YEARS  -  b/c  the  methadone  makes  him  too  tired  and  has  killed  whatever  ambition/drive  he  previously  had.  It's  sad  to  witness.  #Methadone  turns  young  men  into  neutered  cats.
__label__c And  yet  as  I  tapered  off  and  stopped  the  gabapentin  I  found  myself  feeling  sicker  and  sicker.  How  could  this  be?  I  did  some  research.  And  it  turns  out  leaving  gabapentin  is  not  the  smooth  ride  I  was  assured  it  would  be.  Instead  of  doing  deals  ...  (/4)

__label__a It's  great  to  hear  you're  choosing  to  avoid  them,  a  couple  of  family  members  are  addicted  to  Tramadol  and  it's  actually  crazy  the  doctors  keep  giving  it  to  them.  Lola,  I  hope  you  manage  to  find  a  way  to  relieve  the  pain,  the  mental  toll  from  dealing  with  constant  pain  gets  heavy

I  did  say  Lyrica,  not  Lipitor,  however,  and  those  drugs  did  generate  &gt;$7bn  for  $PFE  in  the  US  in  2017.

__label__m NICOTINE  HEROINE  MORPHINE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!  #preorderCAMILAtoday    THE  TRUTH!!!!!!!!!
__label__c On  morphine  right  now,  have  been  for  more'n  12  months,  it's  the  only  thing  keeping  me  fr  constantly  screaming  for  pain  while  trying,  even  on  2  crutches(!),  to  get  from  my  bed  to  the  bathroom  or  back  again.  Opiates  aren't  a  general  anaesthetic,  but  they  are  very  strong  analgetics
__label__m on  the  real  though.  _U  must  stay  on  coffee,  red  bulls,  and  vyvanse
__label__m maybe  oxycodone  kills  in  rare  instances
__label__m I  need  Xanax  and  mayonnaise
__label__a about  to  take  adderall  and  read  since  i  can't  knock  out
__label__c morphine  be  putting  me  out
__label__c thankfully  i  just  got  prescribed    xanax  lol  fuck  this
__label__a took  my  adderall  so  i  could  start  studying  this  morning  and  instead  i  got  distracted  and  organized  my  whole  room.😬
__label__u lyrica  anderson  is  so  talented.
__label__c picking  up  my  script  of  xanax  is  always  a  good  feeling
__label__m _U  Mr.  President  are  you  taking  Xanax  pills  to  calm  your  panties  to  the  opiate  crisis  how  many  bars  have  you  took  him
__label__a Readin’  about  the  opioid  epidemic,  fully  knowing  I  have  a  stash  of  oxycodone  at  home
__label__c off  morphine  now.  so  now  i'm  getting  closer  to  going  home  hopefully  tomorrow  counts  what  the  doctors  say
__label__c i  better  get  my  xanax  refill  today  or  else  i'll  have  a  panic  attack  cause  i'm  a  brat  and  i  get  my  way  with  my  doctor
__label__m _U  since  it's  generic  now,  we  may  look  into  pregabalin  if  his  meds  do  fail.  it's  been  hit  and  miss  but  it's  worth  a  shot  :)
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  seroquel  is  some  strong  shit!
__label__a just  took  50  mg  of  adderall  someone  text  me
__label__m someone  applied  to  la  tan  via  email  and  instead  of  attaching  her  application  she  sent  me  a  copy  of  her  hydrocodone  prescription  😅😅
__label__m i  love  harlequin  quartz  for  focusing  too,  but  vanadinite  is  literally  adderall  in  the  form  of  a  cluster
__label__a vyvanse  for  the  save  once  again
__label__c _U  i'm  lucky  i  had  oxycodone  in  my  system  for  my  wisdom  teeth  pain  when  i  saw  this  cuz  damn
__label__m no  i'm  serious  who  takes  adderall
__label__m _U  take  a  diazepam  🙈😂  you'll  sleep  a  treat  🙈
__label__m xanax  is  a  schedule  4  drug  with  schedule  1  side  effects.  oh  my.
__label__a how  many  xanax  will  it  take  for  me  to  sleep  more  than  3  hours  tonight?      let's  find  out.
__label__m niggas  rlly  tradin  xanax  for  head  man  wtf  is  wrong  with  u
__label__a I  should  have  taken  a  bunch  of  diazepam  for  this  shit.  After.  After  I’m  gonna  get  pleasantly  high  in  the  shower.
__label__u lyrica  i  love  the  black  hair.  😍  #lhhh
__label__a adderall  for  daysssss
__label__m omg  xanax  is  xanax  backwards
__label__m if  we  all  stop  taking  300  xanax  a  day  we  can  save  enough  money  to  buy  soundcloud
__label__c _U  I  honestly  think  I  need  it.  When  I  wake  up  I  feel  like  the  tin  man.  A  large  Macchiato  and  a  few  Gabapentin  and  I  am  like  super  man  (most  times)
__label__c seeing  the  change  between  me  on  quetiapine  and  off  is  major,  it  really  must  be  helping.
__label__c i've  probably  gained  like  20lbs  since  i've  been  off  adderall  ............
__label__c i'm  itchy  af  from  the  morphine  and  this  benadryl  is  taking  forever  to  kick  in  😭
__label__c _U  hydrocodone  for  pain..  i'm  getting  heavy  eyes
__label__c after  putting  off  going  back  to  the  gp  for  stronger  pain  relief  i  gave  up  and  went  now  on  2  different  mg's  of  tramadol  😴  ..
__label__c _U  they  don't  give  me  medication,  just  fluids.  i  turned  down  the  morphine  after  1  day.  i've  been  drinking  a  ton  of  water.
__label__c I  could  really  use  a  hug,  6  cups  of  iced  coffee  and  a  Xanax  right  now...  #PissedButAnxious  #IsThatAThing
__label__u kevin  gates  x  lyrica  anderson    -  feenin  🙌
__label__a A  football  match  between  Corpers  and  Emir's  team.  Although  we  lost  to  2-0  but  what  do  you  expect  from  people  who  take  tramadol  before  coming  to  field...
__label__m _U  aww  shitty  /:  and  adderall  :p  haha
__label__a Got  to  hang  with  Sean  on  election  night  2016,  he  was  in  SLC  crashing  at  my  buddy's.  We  were  drinking  moonshine  and  eating  klonopin.  When  trump  won,  someone  screamed  "But  he's  being  tried  for  rape!"  Sean  looked  at  her  and  said  "Think  he's  got  that  one  beat,  honey".      #RIPRouse
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  4.  because  of  my  having  NEVER  developed  an  addiction  to  anything  that  requires  or  profits  their  Suboxon  agenda.
__label__u _U  danville  dont  care  .  richmond  post  lyrica  like  these  all  the  time
__label__c update:  wasn’t  taken  off  anything  but  my  dr  said  the  weight  loss  from  adderall  will  go  away  with  time
__label__c _U  I'm  actually  getting  off  Suboxone  rn.  Last  one  was  May  7th.
__label__a _U  i  don't  know  where  to  get  adderall  😩😩😭😭
__label__c Right  off  to  have  a  bath  and  freshen  myself  up  before  heading  to  _U  for  an  emergency  appt,  may  have  #’d  my  tooth  from  these  seizures!  :-(  I’m  nice  and  chilled  today  Diazepam  &  Zopiclone  rocks!!  :-)  thanks  to  _U  Forton  and  WarMemorial!  For  prescribing.  Xx
__label__a _U  This  opioid  epidemic  is  heartbreaking.  It  is  disgusting  that  people  sworn  to  do  no  harm  have  created  this  addiction  crisis.  I  lost  my  68  year  old  mom  (who  had  never  taken  drugs)  to  oxycodone  overdose  after  doctors  got  her  hooked  during  cancer  treatment.  :(
__label__c _U  girl  nahh  ,  i  told  you  that  doesn't  want  .  i  took  oxycodone  😂😂
__label__m _U  yo  ass  off  some  oxycontin
__label__a _U  mint,  bourbon,  and  oxycontin  flavored  hazily.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  I  have  had  lyrica    one  of  the  worst  for  me.  Read  the  side  effects.
__label__c _U  thanks  i'm  much  better  really  did  need  the  inpatient  interventions  but  everyone  was  awesome  &  morphine  in  the  iv  don't  suck!😎
__label__m We  would  be  nowhere  without  morphine  and  cocaine,  two  powerful  anesthetics  that  presaged  the  development  of  antibiotics  by  a  long  ways...
__label__c time  to  try  seroquel  for  insomnia.  will  report  back!  #insomnia  #severe
__label__m okay  fucking  imagine,  your  fundamentally  weak  hittin'  the  pooch  with  some  xanax  yeah  just....  ok
__label__m have  contradictory  feelings?yes?you  suffer  from  histrionic  personality  disorder.this  causes  mental  misplacement.try  methadone
__label__m (#losdelsonido)  woman  charged  in  4-year-old  girl's  oxycodone  death:  pennsylvania  woman  charged  in  4-year-old  girl's  dea...    (#oye_victor)
__label__m What  would  she  do-o-o  for  a  xanax  bar?
__label__m _U  venlafaxine  with  seroquel  helps  with  the  chemicals  at  night  to  calm  you  when  nightmares  occur
__label__c _U  seroquel  makes  you  heavy.  my  quess  is  207  lbs
__label__m This  research  seems  to  hyper-promote  Buprenorphine  as  long  term  solution  to  opioid  use  disorder.  It  is  indeed  for  some!  But  without  counter-balance  perspective,  such  as  those  who  recover  w/out  treatment  or  w/  other  types  of  treatment,  “90%  failed  to  respond”?  What  does  that  mean?
__label__c Feeling  a  bit  better  now.  Sulpiride  has  kicked  in.  Brain  is  still  crying  for  risperidone.  Mild  paranoia  briefly  earlier  but  didn't  last.
__label__m _U  Morphine.  *She  answered  shortly,  opening  her  eyes.*
__label__m _U  _U  innit,  first  time  my  mom  had  a  drink  while  wearing  a  morphine  patch  was  interesting  😉
__label__m Cyanide  n  valium
__label__m _U  they  called  telling  em  i  got  searched  and  i'm  "known"  for  having  xanax  😂
__label__u #InjuredMusic  Morphine  that's  what  like
__label__m _U  The  choice  is  yours  do  not  drink  and  drive  after  alcohol  im  not  sure  about  Xanax  merry  Christmas  chip
__label__c _U  _U  Well,  Seroquel  will  definitely  knock  you  out.  Used  it  after  3.11  for  a  few  weeks.
__label__c i  love  you  like  i  love  xanax  which  means
__label__a I've  got  Vyvanse  (adderall)  and  Extra  Strength  Dayquil  in  my  system  at  the  same  time.  Feels  like  my  heart  is  going  at  140bpm  or  so.  I  should  wash  this  down  with  some  _U.  😳
__label__a straightedge  but  I  use  weed,  coke,  morphine,  oxytocin,  alcohol,  and  pretty  much  anything  i  can  get  my  hands  on
__label__m _U  _U  Or  unanimously  world-wide  take  some  sort  of  chill  pill,  and  just  have  a  world-wide  breather  for  a  few  hours,  LoL.  I  Wonder  what  the  cost  of  1  Valium  for  every  person  on  Earth  over  the  age  of  16  would  be.  LOL  😂
__label__a i  need  adderall  to  get  though  these  next  few  days.  👀
__label__m Have  freckles?You  probably  have  BPD.This  causes  bones  to  dissolve.Try  Methadone
__label__m does  xanax  work  for  migraines🚨
__label__c I'm  pretty  sure  these  meds  mess  with  me  to  boot.  They  hurt  my  brain.  The  Invega  and  the  Abilify,  especially  together.  Dunno  what  the  Cogentin  does  but  I  can't  imagine  it's  good  and  it's  for  Parkinson's.  They're  just  throwing  shit  on  a  wall  and  calling  it  art.
__label__m I  saw  a  "News  Story"  about  Xtampza  ER  oxycodone.  It  was  really  an  Ad  dressed  up  as  a  medical  article.  It  was  a  Native  Advertising  commercial...
__label__u TEM  UM  EPISÓDIO  DE  SIMPSON  QUE  A  LISA  TOMA  XANAX  COM  ASSIM
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Someone  needs  a  valium.  That  someone  is  you.
__label__c Abilify  is  something  I  dislike...  gave  me  muscle  twitches  and  made  it  impossible  to  sleep.  (An  issue  of  sleeping  I  already  had  but  it  made  it  worse.)  They  put  me  on  that  before  it  was  released  to  the  rest  of  the  public  to  help  with  depression  and  anxiety.  I  don't  even  think...
__label__c _U  then  i'll  be  such  a  chill  crab  like  going  about  like  a  simple  little  crab,  enjoying  my  chill  crab  life,  &  my  xanax
__label__m _U  Someone  get  this  poor  fool  some  Olanzapine  before  he  hurts  someone.  Will  the  real  Josh  Martinez  please  stand  up?  #BB19
__label__c my  doctor  said  i  should  only  take  the  valium  when  i'm  having  bad  panic  attacks  but  heh...  tricky
__label__m _U:  _U  the  issue  of  tramadol  should  be  taking  seriously  one  boy  i  knew  almost  died,  he  took  4  tablets  to  impress  a  girl  in  bed
__label__m _U  totes  cheaper  then  Valium  :D
__label__m “_U:  adderall  had  me  going  through  all  2'000  photos  on  my  phone  and  putting  them  into  folders”  _U  lol
__label__m love  me,  love  me  that  methadone  it  numb  me
__label__c i  love  that  i  get  adderall  prescribed  to  me  (:
__label__a and  she  cant  even  give  me  meds  like  so  she  just  wants  to  talk.  like  i  have  nothing  to  talk  about  lady  give  me  adderall  so  i  can  pass  school
__label__c Xanax  is  weird  cause  you  supposed  to  take  then  and  be  tired  and  shit.......but  you  end  up  doing    a  bunch  of  weird  Shit.
__label__c when  your  vyvanse  wears  off  and  you  feel  like  you  hate  the  world&lt;
__label__m _U  Lyrica  ,  zendaya  ,  Lucas  coly  ,  Rae  sremmurd  ,  karina  ,  Tiffany  Evans  ,  baby  Rasta  y  gringo  and  popcaan
__label__m lips  blurry  with  alcohol  /  lips  silenced  by  tramadol  /  lips  tied  up  by  summer  sweat's  sweet  salt.
__label__m lmao  that  fucking  adderall  picture
__label__m _U  I  need  a  base  ball  bat  or  Ativan  \o/  day  from  hell
__label__a grammy:  i  made  hard  lemonade!      what?  grammy!    *gmy  holds  up  ice  tray  of  lemonade  icecubes*    whew!  grammy  i  th-    g:  theyre  full  of  morphine!
__label__c waiting  for  this  adderall  to  kick  in  like  "here  i  am  bitchhh"
__label__a took  adderall  to  play  dark  souls
__label__m _U  seems  like  you  are  right  in  the  middle  of  a  manic  episode  -  double  your  quetiapine  🤪🤪🤪
__label__m Nancy  is  77  &  can  barely  form  complete  sentences.  Sounds  like  she's  jacked  up  on  valium  half  the  time.  Nancy  Pelosi  has  a  $196  million  net  worth  on  a  $193,000  senator’s  salary.  How  did  this  happen  &  why  has  this  ding  bat  held  public  office  for  so  long?🤔  #GoNancyGo  #DrainTheSwamp
__label__c _U  vyvanse  gives  me  weird  side  effects.
__label__a and  i  caught  my  dad  tryna  cop  some  of  my  oxycodone  😒
__label__a seriously  want  morphine  right  now.
__label__m _U  _U  you're  the  one  using  all-caps  and  ranting  about  murder.  I  suggest  Xanax.
__label__c _U  My  family  doctor  told  me  the  suboxone  is  a  opioid  pain  pill  it's  just  easier  to  whine  off  of  but,  it'll  work  for  the  pain  I  think.  I'll  ask  my  pain  Doctor  at  my  next  appt.
__label__c _U  gave  me  some  weak  ass  naproxen  🙄  and  weak  ass  valium  ..that  just  puts  me  to  sleep
__label__c they  got  me  on  this  morphine  killing  my  life
__label__a _U  because  you  went  into  a  coma  after  coming  down  from  the  adderall  high
__label__m _U  My  former  neighbor,  a  veterinary  pathologist,  was  on  the  team  that  developed  Xanax.  He  also  thinks  it  is  one  of  the  most  dangerous  drugs  on  the  market  because  it  has  an  incredibly  short  half-life,  thus  very  addictive.
__label__m _U  did  your  friend  get  pain  relief?  so  cruel  to  make  her  suffer.  stressed  mommy  is  worse  for  baby  than  codeine  or  hydrocodone.
__label__m have  a  small  penis?you  probably  have  avoidant  personality  disorder.this  causes  immediate  death.try  xanax
__label__c "can  you  bring  me  spaghettio's?  my  vyvanse  hasn't  kicked  in  yet"  _U  ugh
__label__m Like  sure  you  could  take  the  opium  directly  from  a  poppy  or  you  could  just  take  the  morphine  like  you’re  living  in  the  21st  century  you  fuckin  weirdo.
__label__m need  a  fucking  xanax  right  now  ...  or  10
__label__m _U  I’m  focused  on  that  dolla  you  focused  on  da  xanax
__label__m orgasms  are  natures  valium,  he  whispered,  and  soon  he  was  mansplaining  orgasm  after  orgasm  after  orgasm,  right  to  her  pussy  itself
__label__m Ooto  oro  koro  faaa!!!!  What's  the  percentage  of  tramadol,benilyn  and  gegemu  takers  in  Nigeria;youth  or  adults.
__label__c woke  up  from  a  xanax  sleep  and  all  i  remember  is  i  have  a  boyfriend
__label__m _U  Nah,  I  use  regular  ones  just  like  nicotine,  heroine,  morphine  and  suddenly  I'm  a  fiend
__label__m _U  &  this  is  for  if  you  wanna  be  on  adderall  lol.
__label__m _U  me  dont  like  xanax  :p  _U
__label__m is  that  drunk  _U  or  triple  xanax  ramona?    it's  pretty  tough  to  tell  #suculantchicken  #way2much  #winebreathapology  #rhony
__label__m me:excuse  me  but  is  that  guy  holding  kratom?  police  officer:  no  its  morphine  and  heroin  me:  oh  thank  god!!!!  #iamkratom      #keepkratomlegal
__label__c coming  up  this  week:  seroquel  is  notorious  for  two  things  -  making  you  sleep  until  next  tuesday,  and  leaving  you  a  hangover.    lovely.
__label__m spent  my  saturday  morning  fighting  off  methadone  patients  with  a  pollypocket
__label__c just  woke  up.  oxycodone  had  me  too  slump  lol  my  mouth  dont  hurt  nearly  as  bad  as  it  did  a  couple  hours  ago
__label__c Where  is  my  alprazolam
__label__c _U  I  take  meds  for  nerve  pain  &  restless  leg  syndrome  brought  on  by  Fibromyalgia.  Neurontin  is  the  wonder  drug  for  nerve  pain.
__label__c can't  wait  for  this  xanax  to  kick  in  fuck!!!
__label__m bagel  bites    xanax    emperor's  new  groove
__label__a Reader,  it’s  7:30  on  Friday  night.  I  got  home  an  hour  ago.  I  took  a  bath  and  a  Mexican  Valium  and  got  into  bed.  It’s  been  a  hell  of  a  week.    Mother’s  Day  approaches.
__label__c My  anxiety  is  through  the  roof  rn  someone  send  Xanax  pls😩
__label__c Tramadol  is  a  great  painkiller
__label__a I  wish  I'd  never  given  away  that  adderall  I'm  so  fckin  sick  of  being  able  to  think  of  nothing  but  food  &  the  sudafed  isn  t  helping  at  all
__label__c _U  Where  you  on  long  term  high  dose  suboxone  Film?  How  far  down  did  you  taper  to  before  the  Suboxone  Listerine  elixir?  I  read  even  dropping  from  24mg  to  22mg  could  be  tricky-  but  gets  worse  as  taper  down  progresses.
__label__a i  think  25  xanax  bars  should  do  the  trick
__label__c ativan...  thank  u
__label__m stop  lying  about  paracetamol.    it  works.    stay  off  the  diazepam  and  lorazepam  and  alprazolam.    try  paracetamol.  a  high  enough  iv  dose  works.
__label__m _U  not  sure  what  you  do  for  meds  for  your  bud  but  in  canada  they  now  let  us  use  tramadol  on  our  pooches.
__label__c But  I  feel  like  I  failed  somehow  and  I  wish  I  could  stop  feeling  this  way.  Before  Xanax  I  couldn't  sleep.  Literally,  I'd  be  up  most  of  the  night  sweating,  hyperventilating,  my  heart  beating  so  hard  it  HURT,  nauseous  and  even  vomiting.  It  was  unbearable
__label__m if  you  ever  leave  me  bby,  leave  ur  morphine  at  my  door
__label__c I  hateee  toothaches,  and  I  hate  the  way  Hydrocodone  makes  me  feel..😣
__label__c honest  to  god  i've  taken  more  Ativan  in  a  week  than  I  have  in  the  past  6  months.
__label__c me  next  time  i  actually  need  painkiller:  "i'm  allergic  to  codeine  and  vicodin"    doctor,  probably:  "suuuuuuuuuuuure"
__label__a i’m  having  such  a  bad  mental  health  moment  at  work  i  have  0  ideas  on  what  to  do  about  it  other  than  take  an  unhealthy  amount  of  ativan
__label__c why  is  it  that  every  time  i  need  a  refill  for  my  adderall  this  doctor  is  out  of  town?!  fuck!
__label__c _U  I  used  to  take  diazepam  &  oramorph  before  MRA  for  that  reason!
__label__m if  your  chf  pt  requires  opioid  pain  management,  remember  fentanyl  &gt;  morphine  (because  no  histamine  release)    #medicationmonday  #ems
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Probably  smells  like  smut  films  and  Xanax.  What  a  kitchy  hellhole.  I'd  rather  sleep  under  a  bridge.
__label__m _U  yeah  it's  crap  when  it  turns  out  like  that  :(  just  have  to  get  some  methadone  chatting  on  here!
__label__m just  now  found  out  yall  like  to  pop  tramadol,  meanwhile  i’m  staring  @  the  bottle  i  have  from  my  fucking  accident
__label__m _U  I've  never  been  to  a  concert  where  I  don't  have  an  assigned  seat  like  I  would  need  some  Xanax  😅😂😂😂
__label__m Ye  situation  confusing.  Bc  he  got  fat  but  we  don’t  know  if  it  due  to  pills  he  on  or  he  off.  Bc  u  gain  weight  both  ways.  When  u  on  due  to  constipation  n  off  bc  u  get  ur  hunger  back.  🤷🏻‍♂️or  even  depression  pills  make  u  gain  weight  or  suboxon..  😡  tell  us  Ye!
__label__c diazepam  has  done  it's  job  but  i  was  so  chilled  fairly  sure  i  just  waffled  and  repeated  myself  lol  #whatadiv
__label__m _U  quick  somebody  get  me  a  valium
__label__a _U  ugh  we  gotta  get  high  together  like  on  xanax  and  weed  😈😴😂
__label__m 50%  of  the  online  druggy  community  is  obsessed  with  #Xanax  (a.k.a.  #Alprazolam  or  Alzam).  51%  of  the  online  druggy  community  is  obsessed  with  #Restoril  (a.k.a.  #Temazepam  or  Normison).  I  fall  into  the  latter.  Yes,  we’re  all  too  zoned  out  to  handle  basic  mathematics.  ☕️

__label__m aderall  vs  meth:meth  has  an  extra  methyl  group,  making  it  pass  through  the  blood  barrier  to  your  brain  quicker  and  in  turn  create  more  damage.  Also,  meth  is  composed  of  other  harmful  chemicals  that  you  would  never  find  in  an  adderall  pill.  Know  ya  facts.
__label__m Xanax:  girl  of  the  21st  century

__label__m People  should  learn  very  basic  risk  mitigation.    For  instance,  drink  more  coffee  and  don’t  do  adderall,  it’s  super  illegal  and  very  dangerous...  if  you  want  to  do  drugs  1.  Don’t  sell  them.  2.  Don’t  have  too  much  at  one  time.    This  should  be  simple  stuff...
__label__m It's  like  me    'identifying'  as  a  Vulcan  and  expecting  to  get  pointy  ear  surgery  on  the  NHS  -  I  would  either  be  asked  'are  you  having  a  laugh?  '  or  else  put  on  a  waiting  list  for  some  therapy  &  given  lorazepam  or  something  to  help  with  my  delusions.  But  say  'I  feel  I  am  a  woman..'
__label__m _U  I  was  taking  care  of  a  couple  ex-NICU  grads  in  the  PICU  recently  who  had  been  started  on  seroquel  and  no  one  could  really  explain  it  to  me.  Would  love  to  learn  more  about  this  topic!!

__label__c my  mom's  in  town.  out  of  nowhere.  so  i'm  gonna  take  an  ativan  and  go  eat  with  her.  pray  for  me  y'all.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Lol.  Morphine  in  a  cup  please.

__label__m like  what  is  your  problem  do  you  need  an  ativan  or  something  OR  DO  YOU  JUST  REALLY  NEED  ATTN
__label__m _U  Alcohol  is  allowed  in  the  south,  yet  people  take  codeine,  tramadol,  hemp  etc.  Why  didn't  you  say  it's  because  Alcohol  is  banned  here?

__label__c _U  _U  I  find  exercise  helps  best  just  walking  my  dog  with  the  weather  getting  warmer  it  does  help.  They  had  me  on  Gabapentin  but  it  was  messing  up  my  memory  so  I  took  myself  off  of  it.

__label__u lyrica  is  my  company  tonight
__label__m _U  Exactly  the  type  of  methods  that  Arthur  Sackler  was  a  master  at  employing  and  later  used  by  his  brothers/nephew  to  push  OxyContin  -  the  'safe'  replacement  for  morphine  but  which  actually  turned  out  to  be  much  stronger  -  and  thus  create  the  opioid  epidemic  seen  today!

__label__m _U  _U  "ask  your  doctor  if  seroquel  is  right  for  you."
__label__m _U  That  drugs  are  seized  by  customs  doesn’t  make  them  illegal  outrightly.  Doctors  prescribe  Tramadol  for  people  with  severe  pains  particularly  those  suffering  from  arthritis  as  what  not.  The  seizure  could  have  been  for  a  number  of  other  reasons

__label__m _U  I  have  more  detailed  commentary  on  this  good  but  widely  misrepresented  study—including  that  the  results  endorse  stepped  treatment  w  opioids  as  last  result  (“non-opioid”  arm  includes  tramadol,  an  opioid).

__label__c turns  out  a  major  side  effect  of  adderall  is  anorexia.  this  makes  sense  now.
__label__c between  surgery,  being  in  pain  pre-surgery  i  need  to  be  pumped  with  oodles  of  morphine,  puking  out  food,  spending  2  weeks  in  various  wards,  dealing  with  hospitalisation  bills  and  outpatient,  insurance  and  xrays  and  going  about  with  my  wheelchair  and  walking  frame,  it's  been  a  lot
__label__m Don't  fuck  with  adderall  unless  you  REALLY  NEED  it  kids.  Memory  loss  and  insomnia  are  not  fun.
__label__m _U  I  have  no  personal  experience  with  it,  but  I'm  told  Xanax  helps  with  this  condition  you  have.
__label__c but  i'm  gonna  try  and  calm  down  i'm  already  sleepy  from  my  xanax  so  i'm  gonna  play  some  zelda  and  go  to  sleep
__label__m What  in  the  fuck  is  infowars?  It's  ok.  We  know  you're  a  racist.  You  just  eat  a  few  valium  and  jump  on  the    bandwagon.  You  have  no  clue  about  anything.  How  many  brown  children  (as  you  racists  like  to  say)  have  you  adopted  or  fostered?  Zero.  I'm  sure  your  childhood  sucked
__label__m Don't  even  bother  watching  _U  anymore.  Kaitie  gives  terrible  advice,  Wyatt  is  weak  to  trust  it.  Liam  is  a  fool,  Hope  is  a  homewrecker  and  acts  innocent.

__label__a Taking  4  adderall  in  one  day  causes  some  serious  need  to  clean  and  attention  to  detail

__label__m i  need  a  xanax  omg.
__label__m _U  You  MUST  visit  a  counselor!  It  might  be  the  premenstrual  syndrome  though.  Have  you  heard  about  CLONAZEPAM?  It's  an  awesome  pill.Purified  and  so  but  it's  on  a  special  regime  here.We  have  green  prescriptions  which  means  that  they  will  copy  all  data  from  one's  ID.

__label__m “just  take  the  pain  away”  to  me  this  is  saying  “it  doesn’t  have  to  be  morphine,  give  me  anything  that  will  take  this  pain  away  from  me.
__label__m _U  She  asked  if  he’d  taken  Xanax  AGAIN!  Meaning  she  knew  he’d  done  it  before.  Honestly  the  wedding  shouldn’t  hold  up  because  you  can’t  enter  into  a  legal  contract  intoxicated,  which  he  clearly  was!

Your  lack  of  showering  doesn’t  invalidate  me

__label__m _U  She’s  not  on  morphine,  but  a  different  kind  of  pain  medicine.  She’s  had  quite  a  few  surgeries  in  the  last  three  years.  Pretty  sure  this  has  been  the  worst  of  all.

__label__c My  med  Dr  didn't  even  take  my  blood  pressure  before  prescribing  Clonodine  for  the  Suboxone  sweats.  I  think  it  may  be  causing  sudden  drops  that  could  be  dangerous.
__label__m "_U:  option  1:  sleep  option  2:  vyvanse  and  coffee"  option  #  2  is  so  #savage
__label__c Heyyyyyy  just  saying  the  adderall  regulations  are  absolute  horseshit  and  I  can’t  access  it  despite  being  properly  diagnosed  with  adhd  and  having  a  prescription.  For  the  love  of  god  just  let  the  people  do  meth  so  I  can  remember  the  date

__label__c Tramadol  really  does  hit  the  spot  that  other  pain  relief  medication  misses.  I  could  hardly  walk  3  hours  ago.  Now  just  got  my  normal  strange  hobble  with  no  neck  movements.  Like  a  rusty  C3-PO.

__label__c _U  _U  I'd  say  my  GP  was  telling  me  lies  but  he  did  prescribe  me  Lyrica    (Pregabalin)  for  anxiety  so  he  does  trust  me.  Apparently  it's  worth  money  on  the  street!
__label__m _U  nothing  at  all,  but  because  i  said  something  was  ignorant  people  full  blown  talk  shit.  😂🙄  like  comparing  heroin  to  xanax  was
__label__c _U  gaba  never  worked  for  me  lyrica  did  but  i  gained  massive  weight
__label__m “Got  a  Xanax  crushed  up,  if  you  steal  my  cup  it’ll  get  you  fucked  up”
__label__c _U  till  then  i  gotta  pray  my  body  doesnt  get  accustomed  to  morphine  next  or  im  in  trouble  again
__label__m _U  Com  1  diazepam  tu  resolve
__label__m _U  _U  Could  he  be  crushing  and  snorting  ritalin/adderall?  I  really  think  stimulants  are  his  bag.  They  would  explain  his  manic  episodes.  Meth  does  cause  psychoses...
__label__m “_U:  xanax  is  a  date  rape  drug  and  shawties  pop  them  jawns  freely  😭😭😭  tf”
__label__m Based  on  its  reputation,  I  expected  working  in  an  Aeron  chair  to  be  like  floating  down  a  morphine  river,  but  it's  just  an  unsightly,  overpriced  circulation  killer.
__label__c “Well  I  know  when  I  was  in  the  hospital  they  gave  me  morphine  and  I  saw  Shania  Twain  in  the  desert,  we  were  together,  frolicking.”
__label__c _U  i  try  to  be  asleep  by  11  or  at  least  resting  (nytol,  valerian  and  chamomile  tea),  and  keep  relief  to  hand  (deep  heat/freeze,  mini  tens  for  knee,  tramadol/co-codamol).  cbd  oil  seems  to  lessen  symptoms,  but  too  many  variables  to  say  for  definite.
__label__m The  tests  didn’t  assess  for  gabapentin,  which  Fontaine’s  boyfriend  had  said  she  had  taken  earlier  that  summer.  Wilkie  Gilmore  describes  effects  of  consuming  gabapentin,  which  have  significant  crossover  with  side  effects  of  alcohol.
__label__c Suboxone  is  a  maintenance  drug  that's  used  for  chronic  pain  and  addiction  when  used  in  low  to  medium  doses  2-4mg  and  a  pain  drug  when  prescribed  at  higher  doses  it's  always  tough  the  doctor  said  balancing  my  weight  because  being  heavier  in  my  case  actually  screws  me  in  low  doses
__label__c THE  FIRST  DAY  I  TOOK  TRAMADOL,  I  WAS  IN  MY  HOUSE  AND  I  WAS  GETTING  READY  TO  GO  HOME      COPIED

__label__m _U  Who  wouldn't  enjoy  watching  a  NES  port  of  King  Of  Fighters  seemingly  powered  by  a  morphine  drip?
__label__c i  wonder  what  it  would  be  like  if  i  took  adderall  and  watched  the  walking  dead

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Definitely  they’re  into  the  Coke.    But.  Oxy  and  morphine  are  a  good  high  and  everyone  sometimes  you  has  to  come  down.  To  a  addict,  high  is  high..  but  yeah..    ITA
__label__m _U  Valium  can  also  lead  you  to  leave  ISIS  and  Antifa  literature  all  over  your  hotel  room  and  systematically  stockpile  weapons.

__label__a _U  on  a  side  note,  how  does  adderall  make  you  better  at  football?

__label__m _U  Everyone  took  a  xanax  the  night  of  the  ball.  Easily  mansplainable  😂
__label__c _U  Yea  i  take  a  xanax  for  that  😁

__label__m have  you  urinated  today?you  probably  have  skitzo.this  causes  failure.try  methadone
__label__m _U  he  just  dissed  adderall
__label__c Definitely  was  the  right  decision  to  take  the  codeine  BEFORE  things  got  started  when  sitting  on  the  floor  felt  challenging..  And  now  I've  taken  another,  plus  the  diazepam  to  relax  the  muscles,  I'll  be  sure  to  sleep  well  tonight...  #magicalMySterytour

__label__a Should  I  pop  some  clonazepam?  I  think  I  should.
__label__m Listening  to  Lil  Pump  songs  literally  wants  to  make  me  overdose  on  Xanax
__label__m _U  this  is  why  they  invented  adderall
__label__u I  had  to  add  a  ring  guard  to  my  Morphine  ring  because  it  was  a  little  too  big  and  I  can  feel  the  ring  guard  really  obviously

__label__m _U  my  kids  always  liked  klonopin  mom
__label__c I'm  being  put  on  Seroquel  (Quetiapine)  which  can  help  treat  schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder,  and  depression.  This  isn't  gonna  be  my  permanent  medication.  It's  just  my  starter  meds.  I'll  be  switching  to  something  else  in  a  month  or  two.  Super  excited  c:  I'm  beyond  happy  right  now.
__label__m most  days  jkf  took  codeine,  demerol  and  methadone  for  back  pain,  meprobamate  and  librium  for  anxiety;  barbiturates  for  sleep;  and  ritalin.

__label__m Fun  fact  of  the  day:  Heroin  was  available  over  the  counter  and  promoted  by  doctors  as  a  "non-addictive  morphine  substitute"

__label__m jeremy  corbyn  has  a  fatally  wounded  prime  minister  &  warring  opposition  in  front  of  him  &  he's  savaging  them  like  a  shrew  on  valium  #pmqs
__label__a Three  years  ago  today  i  was  coming  down  from  taking  45+  Xanax,  had  been  found  after  being  in  a  trunk  for  eight  hours  and  then  court  ordered  to  the  psych  ward  for  evaluation.  So  glad  I  have  my  shit  together  now.
__label__m I  never  signed  up  for  hospice.  so  having  to  give  morphine  around  the  clock  to  help  a  hospice  patient  actively  die  is  something  I  never  really  thought  about  doing.    ☹️  I’m  sorry  cookie.  💔
__label__m if  you  don't  know  what  alprazolam  really  is  you  shouldn't  be  taking  them😂
__label__c tramadol  time  aka  honesty  hour
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Lyrica  Survivor's  (official)  FB  Group  has  photos  of  people  with  the  same  kind  of  this  as  a  resource
__label__m _U  _U  Surely  giving  everyone  a  Valium  would  have  been  cheaper  and  have  the  same  effect?.
__label__u So  Zel  styled  Lyrica  &  he  came  up  with  a  red  tank  with  a  lobster  on  it  &  some  red  PU  leather  pants?!?  I  have  questions....
__label__m _U  _U  As  for  the  morphine,  there  is  a  clear  distinction  of  intent:  relieve  suffering  or  bring  about  death?
__label__c people  asking  me  to  pick  up  shifts  when  i've  gotta  get  my  adderall  script  refilled  and  visit  my  gyno.  #hello  #priorities
__label__c Xanax  had  me  like  ..  Did  I  even  take  my  Xanax  yet  ?  .....  I  can't  remem-  Yep  I  did.
__label__m _U  If  you  state  “people  should  continue  doing  it”  referring  to  Xanax  in  ANY  context,  you  are  unexplainably  wrong.
__label__a well  guys  my  new  best  friend  is  named  frank  zank.  he  is  40,  wearing  a  misfits  shirt  and  snorted  an  adderall  in  the  bathroom  on  break.
__label__a _U  binging  on  xanax  and  applesauce.
__label__c lol  adderall  buddies  for  life
__label__m _U  oxycontin  script  for  damaged  ankles  from  wearing  high  heels...od'd
__label__m _U  quetiapine  does  that  sometimes  it’s  a  side  effect  😂😂😂
__label__m _U    too  long  i  would  have  shortened  it  to  oxycontin
__label__m _U  Fair.  But  a  good  dose  of  morphine  in  the  current  climate  sounds  pretty  appealing.
__label__a my  adderall  will  have  me  up  all  night  !  study  sess
__label__c Who  wants  to  play  xbox  here  in  a  few  hours    I'm  gonna  suck  btw  hydrocodone  doing  me  good

__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  heroine,  morphine  suddenly  you're  a  fiend  and  ure  all  I  need.  All  I  need.
__label__m _U  I  was  given  a  summary  of  it.  Take  the  valium.
__label__c bipolar  meds  are  fun;  seroquel  made  me  confuse  dreams  with  reality  constantly,  while  depakote  makes  me  see  them  as  a  separate  but  still  very  real  'universe'  from  reality,  with  re-enterable  storylines  and  themes
__label__m _U  ativan  definitely  not,  all  mine.  gravol-  shoppers
__label__c i  forgot  how  productive  i  can  be  when  i  take  adderall  😂
__label__c _U  i  got  ativan  too  i'm  having  a  blast
__label__m _U  _U  Is  it  Tramadol?

__label__c adderall  got  me  annotating  😂😂👀
__label__m Let's  all  get  IUDs  together.  We  can  take  Valium  and  hold  hands  for  the  painful  part  and  then  get  ice  cream  after.
__label__m @joederosacomedy  do  sometimes  you  think  ur  meds  are  making  things  worse?  but  ur  too  scared  to  stop  or  try  another  med?    team  prozac  &  xanax
__label__a I  ingested  8  plls  4  MG  clonazepam  why  am  I  still  alive
__label__m It’s  because  Suboxone  is  associated  with  being  addicted  to  a  drug.  Stigmatized  before  it  ever  got  started.  That’s  why  I  try  to  remind  people  when  we  stigmatize  a  person  we  stigmatize  ourselves  too.  My  insurance  refused  to  pay  for  it  but  covered  Norco  all  day  long!!❤️❤️❤️😘
__label__u i’m  really  liking  Lyrica’s  album!
__label__m Me:  Hey  doc,  heard  you're  giving  me  narcotics.      Doctor:  No  I'm  not.    Me:  Is  it  morphine?    Doctore:  I'm  not  giving  you  morphine!
__label__m Bet  y’all  won’t  slander  Lil  Peeps  Xanax  plug  like  you  did  his  friends  and  family  but  I’m  sooooooooooo  fucking  sleep  😴
__label__m _U  Maybe  if  they  switch  her  from  Xanax  to  Adirol..  na  that  won’t  help..
__label__c Or  maybe  it’s  because  my  morphine  patch  was  supposed  to  be  changed  2  days  ago.  Nah,  definitely  Brexit.
__label__c i  just  found  out  a  side  effect  of  adderall  is  you  cant  get  an  erection,  no  fucking  wonder
__label__c _U  Oh  Lordy.  Rest,  do  not  do  what  I  did.  Crippled  for  two  weeks  (but  the  morphine  &  Tramadol  helped).  Seriously,  take  a  break.
__label__a hmu  its  friday  xanax  for  lunch
__label__c I  got  the  klonopin  fever!
__label__m _U  _U  this  is  shit.    this  is  nothing  more  than  normalizing  a  mental  disease  and  then  trying  to  give  them  a  sexual  substitute  that  looks  just  like  a  kid?    this  is  methadone  for  perverted  people  where  castration  and  labotomies  are  called  for.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  A  spoonful  of  Nutella  helps  the  crushed  up  Xanax  go  down.
__label__c _U  Tramadol  for  pain.    Now  down  to  one  every  four  or  so  hours
__label__m _U  :(  have  you  tried  gabapentin  or  lyrica?
__label__m _U  Give  me  a  paper  towel  give  me  another  Valium  give  me  another  hour  or  two

__label__m High  dose  methadone  blocks  other  potent  mu  receptor  agonists,  thus  its  utility  in  medication  assisted  treatment  for  addiction.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Are  you  on  Alprazolam,  Diazepam,  or  maybe  just  a  wee  75mg  of  Doxepin.
__label__c _U  I’ll  be  out  on  valium  and  stilnox  I  don’t  care  ha  ha
__label__m Adderall  will  help  me  fffffffd

__label__m “_U:  12.  xany  or  addy  ?”  xanax  i  guess.
__label__c i  have  add.  i  wish  i  could  take  adderall  every  day.  but  that  requires  a  docs  appointment  once  a  month.  i  already  have  weekly  appointments.
__label__m _U  _U  Idk.  Shes  not  speaking  to  me.  It's  crazy.  I'm  pretty  sure  she  started  after  weaning  off  Klonopin  while  she  was  pregnant.
__label__c the  only  problem  with  being  on  adderall  is  when  i  take  a  break  it  turns  into  focusing  on  everything  too  much
__label__a _U  i  wonder  if  i  can  sneak  xanax  on  a  plane  if  i  put  it  with  allergy  medicine
__label__c i  think  the  only  thing  that  can  cure  this  headache  is  morphine
__label__m Do  adderall.  Alphabetize  your  soup.

__label__m Roger  on  Morphine!  LOL  _U    #LethalWeapon
__label__m All  drugs  have  about  the  same  allure  to  a  kid  who  is  interested  in  trying  drugs.  Educating  kids  about  opiate  addiction  is  absolutely  critical.  A  teen  who's  offered  a  beer,  some  weed  &  a  hydrocodone  needs  to  understand  the  difference  in  order  to  make  a  good  choice  for  their  life.
__label__c _U  Thanks  so  much,  diazepam  kicking  in  thank  the  stars,  hugs  truly  welcome  💛💚

__label__m i'd  rather  be  sober  than  taking  a  xanax
__label__m _U  not  without  2  panic  attacks  and  a(n?)  xanax  😂  good  luck  finding  them!

__label__m _U  It  wasn't  just  his  last  remark.  He  was  clearly  impaired.  Too  many  Xanax?
__label__m Serious  question:  What  is  it  about  #Gabapentin  that  causes  weight  gain?  Not  just  a  few  pounds,  but  ppl  gaining  25-50-100  pounds.  Does  it  affect  metabolism?  Increase  appetite?  Fluid  retention?  I  read  so  many  ppl  saying  they’ve  gained  a  lot  of  weight  while  taking  it.  #pain  #opioids
__label__m xanax  is  one  of  the  worst  fucking  drugs  out  there

__label__c Sat  in  the  garden  trying  to  read  but  I’ve  had  to  stop  having  read  the  same  page  6  times.  Keep  dozing  off  -  4  more  days  of  Diazepam
__label__m is  hydrocodone  bad?
__label__m _U  I’m  sure  she  will  be  released  soon,  tramadol  isn’t  a  big  deal  in  Egypt
__label__a sorry,  twitter,  for  the  impulsive  adderall  abuse  and  consequent  attack  of  hyper-focused  tweets.  xoxox.
__label__m _U  klonazepam,  actually,  but  diazepam  works  in  a  pinch.

__label__m Have  you  seen  a  commercial  lately?  I  feel  hypnotized,  complacent,  and  desperately  in  need  of  Lyrica.
__label__c someone  measure  the  tramadol  in  my  blood  so  I  can  see  if  I'm  on  edge  coz  of  withdrawal  please
__label__u They  need  to  get  rid  of  methadone  mick.  He  isny  funny  #stillgame
__label__c _U  tell  your  cousin  that  "noise"  is  fucking  distressing.  I  have  an  anxiety  disorder  and  it  made  me  pull  out  the  xanax
__label__m _U  Is  medication  ever  a  good  choice,  klonipin,  xanax?
__label__c I  used  it  after  a  car  accident  and  never  had  an  issue,  but  when  it  comes  to  pain  meds  alot  of  them  dont  work  but  the  oxycontin  worked  great.    Unfortunately  these  pharmaceutical  companies  are  businesses  and  must  sell  their  product.  How  else  do  you  expect  them  to  pay  employees.
__label__m _U  2mg  de  clonazepam  y  te  noqueas  beibe
__label__m can  some1  explain  how  hilly,  billy,  obammy,  etc.  remember  all  their  lies?  no  press  conf  4  fear  of  slip  up?  2  much  diazepam  will  do  that  2  ya
__label__m _U  _U  You  look  bloated  and  doped  up  on  Xanax  and  the  insincere  teleprompter  reading  is  just  awful.
__label__u liars  and  thieves  I  say  burn  them  after  killing  them    with    morphine  and  lyrical  opium    #punketry
__label__c Im  not  usually  petty  but  tonight  i'm  feeling  fiesty...it  may  be  the  xanax  and  the  sleep  meds
__label__c adderall  has  me  way  too  worked  up  about  the  fact  that  my  highlighter  is  running  out  of  ink
__label__m _U  that  sounds  terrifying  and  awful.  i'm  glad  morphine  is  working.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  gabapentin  seems  to  be  common  for  ms  pain  but  never  helped  me.  only  strong  pain  meds  help
__label__m now  i  am  really  antsy  for  the  tour  i  need  a  xanax
__label__m _U  ugh.  you  need  a  xanax  to  level  your  sss  out.  or  a  few  drinks.  feel  better.
__label__m Medical  marijauna  oil  qid  cost  $16.00/day  eg  2ml  Qid..versus  oxycodone  60  mg  /  day  $2.00  or  90mg  of  morphine  $2.00  /  day..  For  individuals  over  100kg  dose  should  be  up  to  120mg  of  of  oxycodone    or  morphine  180  mg  /  day..the  CNCP  guidelines  2017  doesn't  take  into  account  of  weight
__label__c _U  Hoping  the  morphine  will  knock  back.
__label__m is  lendl  on  valium  or  something
__label__m _U  or  an  endogenous  morphine  release,  following  after  noradrenaline/dopamine  flushes  from  interpersonal  invasion
__label__m _U  _U  _U  The  truth  is,  Tramadol  is  not  the  only  drug.  There  are  alot  more  higher  than  that.  You  need  to  take  cautions
__label__m _U  Morphine  probably.  Lots  of  oral  morphine.  If  you  are  allowed  to  eat  afterwards  then  awful  food.  Oh  and  immense  relief  it's  all  over.

__label__m _U  _U  ah  yes,  got  the  two  mixed  up  adderall  similar  -  both  stimulant  drugs  and  as  you  say  both  issued  to  kids  -no  prob.
__label__m just.  please  don’t  fucking  do  xanax  recreationally,  don’t  do  klonopin  recreationally,  don’t  do  atavans  recreationally,  just  please  fucking  don’t.    even  if  you  have  anxiety.  unless  you’re  taking  them  as  prescribed,  don’t.
__label__c _U  &lt;  reduce  the  sweating  as  a  side  effect  of  the  quetiapine  &  sertraline.  hopefully  there  is  something  that  will  help  a  bit!
__label__c _U  _U  Get  on  a  low  dose  of  anti  depressant,    even  if  you're  not  depressed  at  all,  and  havs  a  couple  of  xanax  around  for  emergencies.  I  have  panic  disorder  and  this  approach  fixed  me  right  up.
__label__c I  think  Bran's  acting  is  on  point.  He  acts  kinda  like  me  when  I'm  on  Adderall  I  think  if  you  take  4  Adderall  you  become  the  3-Eyed  Raven

__label__m i  wonder  if  taking  xanax  recreationally  will  increase  a  persons  risk  to  develop  mental  illnesses
__label__m _U  Given  that  they  normally  need  sedation  in  ED,  not  sure  20mg  morphine  would  be  sufficient.

__label__c _U  Yeah.  Anecdotally,  I  had  to  switch  from  Ritalin  to  Adderall,  because  I  was  wishing  very  bad  things  on  the  4.5  GOP  regime.
__label__c i've  taken  a  valium  every  night  of  the  week  so  i  can  sleep  and  i  can't  refill  my  prescription  for  another  week  but  this  is  an  emergency!

__label__m The  know  it's  not  going  to  help.    This  is  all  part  of  a  larger  plan.    They  want  our  "data"  to  sell  as  evidenced  by  Appriss,  the  PDMP.    I  am  convinced  of  this.    It's  no  longer  just  about  getting  us  all  deemed  as  having  OUD  so  we  can  take  Suboxone.    they  also  want  our  data  $$$$$$

__label__m sad  how  kids  fuck  up  there  college  education  all  because  they  can't  stop  taking  xanax  and  listening  to  56  nights.  smh
__label__m _U  Maybe  not  the  adderall  part  but  hell  yeah
__label__c when  we  were  at  the  hospital  back  in  August  when  I  miscarried,  they  gave  me  a  1000mg  Hydrocodone  &  that’s  when  I  realize  I  can  no  longer  take  pain  killers  unless  i’m  dying  (like  I  feel  rn).
__label__c _U  Same  *takes  an  Ativan  to  top  it  off*
__label__a you  know  you're  too  fucked  up  on  adderall  when  you  can't  pronounce  the  word  adderall
__label__m _U  You’re  acting  as  if  I  just  ran  over  your  cat,  chill  out  it  was  a  simple  mistake.  Why  are  you  getting  so  stressed?  Pop  a  Xanax  of  something
__label__m _U  I  think  we  need  to  switchem  to  a  longer  acting  benzo....  perhaps  valium
__label__c _U  still  hurts  tuesday  they  gave  me  gabapentin    and  today  diclophenic  bi  was  going  down  stairs  and  my  leg  gave  so  i  suddenly  sat
__label__c when  my  morphine  makes  me  super  chatty  and  there's  no  one  home  too  chat  too  😏  i'm  now  a  crazy  lady  talking  too  my  dogs  🐶🙄
__label__a in  other  news,  does  anyone  have  any  adderall
__label__m i  need  a  xanax  after  that  first  period.  sheesh!  #nomoreinjuries
__label__c i  badly  need  to  find  a  new  painkiller  for  when  my  back  flares  up  -  tramadol  is  killing  me  here.
__label__c _U  Thanks,  it  was  the  no-valium  talking!
__label__m white  people  getting  (box)  braids  is  the  next  big  indie  trend  so  buckle  ya  seat  belts  and  take  a  xanax  bc  we  can't  fight  them  all.
__label__a fuck  coffee  i  need  adderall  to  pass  this  bio  exam
__label__m _U  journies:  uh,  mr  vice  president?  are  you  okay?  me:  nah  it's  cool  he  just  needs  his  candies  *tosses  you  another  altoids  tin  of  powdered  adderall*  low  blood  sugar,  you  know?
__label__c i  took  a  xanax  and  started  thinking  about  sudoku  and  now  my  head  hurts
__label__c adderall  kick  in  and  im  talkin  alexs  damn  ear  off:(
__label__m _U  _U  Mmmm  Oxycodone  &lt;3  I  think  I  may  have  missed  the  point  here..
__label__m Oxycontin  was  20th  on  the  list  of  blockbusters  back  in  2013  -  a  generic  making  less  than  half  what  Abilify  generated  that  year.
__label__m "henry  don't  ask  for  extra  morphine  just  because  you  like  the  dreams"
__label__c _U  YAY,    am  on  them,and  gabapentin,and  tramadol,and  co-codamol,  X
__label__u Lyrica’s  wig  looks  awful  #LHHHReunion
__label__m )))):  my  dad  doesn't  have  anymore  xanax  and  now  he's  buggin  the  fuck  out  sigh
__label__m there's  methadone  for  heroin;  why  isn't  there  a  stevia  program  for  quitting  sugar?
__label__c i  feel  like  shit  and  don't  want  to  work  but  i  just  took  an  adderall  so  i'm  getting  something  done  today.
__label__m Wanna  girl  with  lips  like  morphine;  knock  me  out  every  time  they  touch  me.
__label__m you  get  an  adderall  and  *you*  get  an  adderall  and  *you*  get  an  adderall
__label__m _U  ...they  all  became  heroin  addicts  but  the  good  news  is  they  are  now  methadone  addicts.
__label__c In  too  much  pain  to  sleep,  can’t  get  comfy  and  the  tramadol  doesn’t  seem  to  be  doing  much.  All  I  want  to  do  is  not  be  able  to  feel  pain  for  just  a  few  hours  😫
__label__m _U  i  liked  critiquing  the  narrative  of  harm-reduction  measures,  like  methadone  substitution,  as  cures  for  addiction.
__label__c _U  yeah  my  vitals  were  good...lack  of  food  and  dehydrated  taking  that  hydrocodone
__label__c I  took  half  a  Xanax  to  get  through  my  day...  happy  Monday  I  guess
__label__m Now  running  a  cat  hospice  house...if  your  cat  is  dying  I've  got  the  nip  and  the  morphine
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Funny  consequence  that  really  isn't  being  discussed  ..  we  have  a  nationwide  shortage  of  not  just  fentanyl  but  also  Morphine,    Dilaudid,  and  Ketamine  in  hospitals.    It's  affecting  surgeries  and  pain  relief  of  patients  every  day.
__label__m I  need  to  be  prescribed  adderall.  Somebody  DM  me  a  doctor
__label__m that  recent  news  about  oxycontin  marketing  hhhhhhHHHhh
__label__u me  and  lyrica  can  talk  all  day  i  miss  her  man.
__label__m i  will  be  the  cause  of  the  prince  of  death  and  has  an  overdose  of  oxycontin  or  oxycodone
__label__m Sweetie,  take  this  zyprexa,  turning  psycho  again?
__label__c _U  It's  broken,  but  it's  better.  They  gave  me  Lorazepam  for  my  anxiety...
__label__a who  tf  has  adderall  rn
__label__c I'm  kinda  worried  about  my  pain.  Naproxen  does  nothing  to  calm  the  pain.  Only  meloxicam  or  tramadol  really  help  me.
__label__c Part  of  the  problem  is  stupid  hysteria  being  created.  Any  drug  can  be  abused  its  the  Wrongful  prescibing.  I  myself  have  used  it  legimatly  for  6  years.  With  advanced  Rheumatoid  Arthitis  that's  completely  crippled  my  hands  my  life  would  have  been  horrible.  Morphine  does  more  damage
__label__m &  since  i'm  on  the  subject,  xans  not  cute  either.  xanax  is  an  anti-depressant.  a  mood  stabilizer.  medicine.  prescription  drug.  y'all  sick?
__label__c woke  up  bawling  in  my  sleep  defs  need  my  lorazepam  asap  rocky
__label__c tramadol  is  a  wickedpain  killer  never  felt  so  ill
__label__c very  appreciative  of  the  fact  that  i  get  prescribed  seroquel
__label__m oxycodone  is  no  joke,  guys.  🌀
__label__c when  diazepam  doesn't  even  work  for  my  anxiety  anymore..
__label__c _U  who  fucking  knew!  but  the  pain  was  horrendous.  after  my  amazing  hospital  visit  i  was  sent  home  with  tons  of  oxycontin  &  +
__label__c i  need  a  valium  idk  whats  up  https://t.co/QZY5bcAGzI  rn
__label__m Like,  honestly  ok,  so  she’s  old-  but  they’ve  refused  her  treatment  for  so  long-  she’s  been  on  morphine  for  the  past  few  months  because  of  the  pain,  and  doctors  still  refused  her  treatment.
__label__m _U  lmao  i'm  trolling  stay  far  away  from  xanax
__label__m so.  we're  probably  getting  two  kittens  today.  i'm  thinking  we  should  call  them  lorazepam  and  fluoxetine.
__label__m You  can  get  a  side  of  oxycodone  or  lithium  if  you  ask  politely
__label__m Not  even  a  Xanax  could  get  him  through  this  day.                      Ugh.
__label__c _U  Hi,  I  quit  once  (now  have  to  quit  again  UGH)  dr  gave  me  a  low  dose  script  for  Xanax,  because  my  anxiety  went  into  overdrive
__label__c Bed  time,  Ativan,  spiked  seltzer...  and  diesel  jeans
__label__u _U  wait  in  the  lyrica  he  says  dick  ??
__label__c _U  yes  i  have  a  supply  but  it  puts  me  to  sleep  too  much,  i  tried  gabapentin  but  all  that  did  after  a  while  was  change  my  mood
__label__m Not  only  xanax  gonna  betray  you
__label__m _U  METRO  OWNS  MOST  METHADONE  CLINCS  ALL  ABOUT  MONEY  VERY  NASTY  PLACES  THEY  HAVE  80  YEAR  OLD  DOCTORS  SIGNING  OFF  ON  USAGES  OF  METHADONE  IF  YOU  ARE  GOING  AFTER  THE  MOST  SIMPLE  WAY  TO  GET  ADDICTED  METHADONE  CLINCIS  ARE  IT
__label__m _U  _U  True.  Hitler  had  scrofula,  took  cocaine  injections  &  was  a  coprophiliac;  Goebbels  had  a  club  foot  and  raped  women;  Goering  was  morbidly  obese,  a  morphine  addict  &  a  cross-dresser;  Himmler  was  a  child  molester…that’s  just  for  starters…
__label__a pretty  sure  i  just  aced  that  psych  exam.  thank  the  lord  for  adderall
__label__c _U  at  least  i  got  off  lyrica  years  ago.  that  stuff  was  wild.  nerves  on  edge  if  a  few  hours  off.  gross!
__label__u i  think  it's  kind  of  like  people  mix  up  lunasa  and  lyrica  a  lot  and  then  they  either  remember  merlin  or  forget  her  entirely
__label__m the  pot  of  coffee  i  drank  this  morning  has  me  feeling  like  i've  been  awake  on  adderall  for  3  days
__label__c I  guess  socialising  in  the  real  world  with  other  humans  again  is  the  first  step.    *goes  for  a  lie  down  with  Valium*
__label__m _U  “THEY  WANT  FUCKING  CAMELS  AT  THEIR  WEDDING  IN  TWO  WEEKS  HOW  THE  FUCK?!?!”  It’ll  be  like  Starbucks  customers  on  morphine
__label__m _U  Ohhhh  I  see  😁  In  my  unprofessional  opinion  any  lowering  of  the  quetiapine  dose  is  a  good  thing!  x
__label__m Facher:"Purdue  Pharma,  manufactures  opioid  painkiller  OxyContin,  announced  in  February  no  longer  directly  market  drug  to  doctors,  major  shift4company  that  has  shouldered  increasing  share  of  the  blame  for  national  crisis."
__label__c _U  I  have  a  problem  with  a  medication  I  am  on  0.5mg  of  clonazepam  for    depression  problems,  Ontario  pharmacy's  are  saying  Ontario  is  short  the  medication  until  end  of  Feb.  I  need  help  my  number  is  647-774-1976  my  name  is  Lynda  Brownlee  I  need  help  PLEASE  Doug
__label__c this  oxycodone  isn't  numbing  the  pain  like  i  had  hoped.
__label__c Gas  station  wouldn’t  read  my  car;  had  to  pay  inside.  Drove  off  without  putting  the  gas  in.  Sorry,  just  the  resident  Xanax  girl
__label__a adderall  will  help  me  get  through  these  next  two  days  of  hell
__label__c i  take  zoloft  effexor  seroquil  xr  and  occasionally  clonopin
__label__m Tramadol  can  seize  your  breathing  ability  right  from  the  brain  and  eventually  lead  to  death.  -  Dr.  Nora  #AHAC17
__label__c The  last  48  hours  have  been  hell.  I  feel  like  oxycodone  gut  punched  me  with  a  broken  bottle  all,  "u  wot  m8?!"  then  ibuprofen  was  like,  "I'll  hold  her  down!"  so  I  got  away  and  ran  to  Excedrine  and  Excedrine  is  like,  "I'll  help,  but  no  heavy  lifting.  Let's  stay  up  all  night!!!"  -_-
__label__a _U  i  used  to  mix  vodka  and  oxycontin  you'll  be  fine.
__label__m Post  Malone’s  new  album  should  come  equipped  with  a  bottle  of  liquor  a  Xanax  bar  and  a  box  of  tissues.
__label__m _U  😂😂😂Wanda  is  currently  smashing  the  lorry  up.  I've  fed  my  mother  tramadol  and  she's  called  asleep...  let's  do  this!
__label__m _U  _U  Hell,  my  co-workers  suggested  that  I  try  a  trifecta  to  get  rid  of  my  vertigo...  allergy  meds,  valium  and  edibles.  They  clearly  love  me...
__label__a i  feel  like  i'm  always  unnecessarily  commenting  on  ppl  who  i  wouldn't  normally  interact  withs  posts  when  i  eat  xanax  tie  my  hands  up
__label__m took  a  sudafed  and  i  feel  like  i'm  on  50  mg  of  vyvanse
__label__a tonight  we  blew  so  much  adderall
__label__c _U  It  happens  to  me  at  work  and  I  sometimes  just  go  out  to  my  car  and  take  a  30.  Min  nap.  I  thinks  it’s  the  Gabapentin.      Fortunately  work  doesn’t  say  a  thing
__label__a _U  Combining  codeine,  naproxen  and  Pregabalin
__label__a give  me  a  pill  of  xanax
__label__m At  70,  she  was  diagnosed  with  bone  cancer  in  1994.  She  died  12  weeks  later  in  her  bed  at  home,  refusing  anything  except  morphine...i  cared  for  her  the  last  4  months  she  lived  until  she  took  her  last  breath.  Everyday  she  screamed  because  the  bones  from  her  hips  to  her  toes  were
__label__c _U  i'm  using  tramadol  for  the  pain,  zoloft  for  my  depression,  anxiety  and  something  to  calm  my  stomach,  nexium  i  think
__label__m _U  Clearly  having  an  adverse  reaction  to  medication.    Wouldn't  be  surprised  if  she  took  ativan  or  something  similar....This  doesn't  looklike  a  mental  health  issue...FOX,  give  it  a  rest  until  you  have  some  facts....
__label__m _U  _U  _U  I’m  skeptical.  Before  morphine  all  you  could  do  with  a  wounded  soldier  was  to  hit  him  on  the  head.  Not  nice.  Not  nice  at  all!
__label__m i  just  had  to  pretend  i  overdosed  on  morphine  and  was  dying  in  class.
__label__m _U  Honestly,  the  Rx  opioids  are  stronger,  and  they  all  feel  pretty  much  the  same  anyway.  Seems  like  the  main  reason  people  get  hooked  on  H  as  opposed  to,  say,  oxycodone  is  cus  it’s  cheap  and  easily  available.  That’s  about  it.
__label__m like  i'll  prolly  never  try  xanax  cuz  i  know  me.
__label__a i  need  an  adderall  hookup
__label__m _U  Xanax  or  Oxy?
__label__m _U  Do  you  have  evidence  the  shooters  were  under  the  influence?    Did  the  use  Adderall  to  murder  their  classmates?
__label__m _U    marketing  last  years  4th  &  6th  placed  teams  is  like  watching    methadone  users...addicted  and  on  your  way  out  but  happy  for  a  fix
__label__m _U  _U  _U  we  need  xanax  as  a  service
__label__m The  gel  +  tylenol  PRN    should  be  adequate.  Is  the  imipramine  used  to  treat  pain  or  mood?  Mental  health  and  tramadol=Yikes  (If  this  is  something  she  will  be  dealing  with  chronically.)  I  have  arthritis  in  my  neck  and  voltaren  alone  works  great.  (For  MH/Pain  biofeedback.  Seriously)
__label__m watched  a  commercial  claiming  the  drug  abilify  can  cause  a  gambling  problem.    you  can't  blame  drugs  for  being  a-hole  what's  trump  taking?
__label__c _U  i’ll  never  forget  the  taste  of  suboxone
__label__m _U  _U  Legitimately  I  think  it's  a  painkiller/anaesthetic  similar  to  morphine.    Dealers  will  lace  heroin  with  it  to  give  it  more  of  a  kick,  but  it's  much  stronger  than  heroin  so  overdose  is  easier.
__label__m _U  1.Its  so  sad.  I've  just  finished  my  rounds  Masvingo  'Provincial'  hospital.  We  only  have  3  antibiotics.  2  analgesics  (  pethidine  and  morphine).  one  anti-epileptic    (  diazepam).  One  kind  of  drip  for  sale  (  N.  Saline)    @  $3/  unit.  0  antiacids.  No  ECG/  CT  scan.  0  xray  films
__label__c vyvanse  is  great  because  you  have  no  emotion  towards  other  people,  you  just  hate  everyone  :)  and  have  straight  a's
__label__c One  of  those  days  I  regret  not  renewing  my  Diazepam  perscription.
__label__c Lovely  when  the  hospital  give  me  cocodemol    at  6am  then  tramadol  at  9am  then  take  my  obs  and  wonder  why  my  heart  rate  was  91🙃    this  hospital  is  pathetic
__label__m _U  Need  a  blunt  and  some  xanax  type  of  day
__label__c Post-op  day  3:  less  sore  today!  No  hydrocodone  for  the  last  12+  hours.  Icing  and  elevating  as  much  as  possible,  my  2  fave  guys  stopped  by  to  see  me.  #haglunds  #achillesresection  #recovery
__label__c Sigh...  I’m  done  with  trying  to  be  happy  and  #positive.  Ready  to  go  back  to  bed.    And  be  alone  with  the  humming  and  Ativan.  Life  is  too  much  lately.  😥  And  I  know  nobody  wants  to  hear  it  anymore...  #isuck  #sad  #noenergy
__label__c _U  _U  _U    i  will  talkbto  the  doctor  about  the    dose  when  i  see  them  lyrica  i  am  on  200  mg  twice  a  day
__label__m "xanax  is  the  devil"  uhhhh  last  time  i  check  xanax  didnt  make  u  take  4  times  the  normal  dosage  lol
__label__m _U  are  you  a  little  retarded?  Srsly,  oh  my  god,  you're  like  white  trash  with  connections  and  klonopin.
__label__m nothing  like  almost  smashing  into  the  back  of  a  broken  down  bakkie  on  the  highway  to  get  the  blood  pumping.  anyone  got  valium  for  me?
__label__c i  don't  believe  the  vyvanse  and  want  to  be  my  bike  shipped  to
__label__a who  drinks  coffee  to  stay  awake  anymore,  just  take  an  adderall
__label__c just  waiting  for  the  seroquel  to  knock  me  out  so  i  can  be  saved  from  the  absurd  throbbing  in  my  head.
__label__u #lhhh  lyrica  was  signed  to  timbalands  label  hemce  why  her  song  sounds  like  that
__label__m _U  She  meant  medical  sedation,  they’re  way  too  uptight  for  that  amount  of  Valium  here.    This  is  in  upper  north  shore  Sydney.  I  told  her  if  she  is  gonna  pay  for  4  weeks  of  hospital  stay  then  I’d  consider  it,  otherwise  hell  NO.
__label__a should  i  redownload  tinder.  should  i  try  to  buy  adderall  from  someone.  should  i  shave  my  head
__label__c adderall  got  me  feeling  ready  to  climb  mount  everest  or  run  a  marathon
__label__a my  friend  was  carrying  an  l  in  her  pocket  after  that  and  my  other  friend  took  an  oxycodone  pill  .
__label__a The  struggle  is  between  getting  no  sleep  or  risking  a  tiny  overdose  of  morphine  and  too  much  sleep  and  not  waking  up  early....😩
__label__m _U  _U  _U  he  took  a  ride  in  the  van  !!  (Ativan)  😱😱😱😰😤
__label__m _U  Niggas  druggies  Lmaooooo  who  tf  pop  Xanax  for  fun.

__label__m jaylla  and  her  coworker  are  casually  talking  about  adderall  and  xanax.  can  i  just  order  a  sandwich
__label__c Ambulance  came  for  me.  BP  89/108,  heart  rate  117.  EMT  gave  me  an  immediate  shot  of  Ativan,  but  heart  rate  is  still  consistently  over  105...
__label__a ok  i'm  so  done  with  this  shit  get  me  a  xanax  and  some  wine  pls
__label__c When  you  take  Advil,  caffeine  pills,  &  Xanax  to  get  thru  the  day,  there's  a  problem.  #retailhell  #overthehill  #betterlivingthroughchemistry
__label__m if  you  do  xanax  you're  already  enough  of  an  idiot  but  if  you  post  about  it  and  try  to  act  like  it's  cool  you're  a  fucking  loser.
__label__m It's  about  time.  This  was  a  Fraud  from  it's  inception.  Frieden  wanted  to  punish  Purdue  and  its  distributors  and  force  a  reduction  in  prescribing  of  Oxycontin  and  opiates  in  general.  Trump  then  made  it  a  grander  more  murderous  plot  to  deprive  all  chronic  pain  pts,#GOVERNMENTSLIE

__label__a i  add  should  seriously  search  my  bag  for  the  adderall  i  lost  in  it
__label__m Pretty  sure  spam  just  offered  me  an  “Adderall  scrub,”  which  I  assume  is  a  topical  amphetamine  that  will  clear  my  skin  AND  make  me  hyper-productive.  What  a  future  we  live  in.

__label__m honestly,  seems  like  a  little  setback  for  the  project  to  remodel  society  so  you  can  be  thrown  in  jail  if  someone  who  eats  10  Xanax  a  day  says  that  you  made  them  cry  from  harassment    it's  gonna  get  pretty  dicey  separating  the  bad  kind  of  harassment  from  the  good  kind,  I  think
__label__m the  first  5  minutes  after  taking  c4  almost  feels  like  the  come  up  on  adderall  lolol

__label__m yuuuung  leeeeean  in  the  club  for  some  morphine  moorphine
__label__m _U  _U  _U  OxyContin  is  extended  release  and  very  expensive.  They  will  pay  for  immediate  release  opioids.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  i  had  morphine  when  in  extreme  pain  -  it  would  not  have  worked  if  i  had  abused  it.
__label__a xanax  hits  you  like  a  car  going  40
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Yes,  we  wanted  all  the  scientists  and  Gestapo  guys  to  learn  from.  Nazi  influences,  Big  Pharma,  Ritalin  and  Adderall,  for  the  kids.  All  the  wacky  stuff  at  Plum  island.  Psychology  is  German.  Swat  teams  refer  to  their  helmets  as  the  Klaus.  We’re  old  buddies.
__label__m This  article  is  completely  wrong..oxycontin  does  remove  REAL  pain...the  problem  is  patients  werebeing  prescribed  because  they  saw  it  easy  to  access  for  little  pain..it  is  not  the  user  nor  the  drug  at  fault  it  is  the  addict  WHO  abuses  the  drug,  who  is  ruining  it  for  Real  sufferer
__label__c The  new  ER  oxycodone  product  Xtampza  requires  you  to  eat  it  with  fat  for  it  to  properly  absorb.  That  means  it  requires  the  enzyme  Lipase.  I  worry  that  the  prescription  version  I  take  which  actual  comes  from  pigs  may  not  allow  it  to  absorb  properly.

__label__c Agreed!  Worst  thing  happened  last  time  I  saw  my  psych  was  I  found  out  he  had  not  believed  I  was  in  extreme  pain  and  needed  opioid  meds  for  last  9  years.  Didn’t  realize  how  much  that  would  hurt.  I’ll  still  see  him  for  Xanax.
__label__m _U  I  have  seen  several  old  dogs  gain  their  old  spring  and  zip  via  tramadol!  They  all  look  healthy  and  happy  and  their  owners  elated.  No  addiction  drug  sales  or  canine  heroin  ods  to  my  knowledge

__label__m _U  Call  me  lil  hydrocodone
__label__m _U  Alleges  the  drugs  involved  are  Clonazepam,  Duloxetine,  Guanfacine,  Geodon,  Olanzapine,  Latuda  and  Divalproex,  plus  some  currently  unidentified  injected  drugs.  I  believe  some  of  these  are  extremely  dangerous  for  young  kids/developing  brains.    Could  turn  into  a  major  scandal.
__label__m Last  night  I  had  a  dream  I  found  a  bottle  of  adderall  in  my  drawer  and  got  so  pumped....smfh

__label__m "i  had  shrooms  for  breakfast  and  adderall  for  dessert"
__label__m Does  methadone  cause  EVERYONE  swelling?  Or  are  there  hundreds  of  thousands  of  OUD  patients  who  live  normal  lives  due  to  methadone?  I'm  strongly  against  use  of  methadone  for  pain  management,  but  "blanket"  statements  stop  some  with  SUDs  from  benefiting.  Cite  real  data!!!!
__label__c Kinda  nice  to  feel  like  I  don't  have  to  rely  on  it,  even  though  I  may  benefit  a  smudge  from  a  baby  sized  dosage  of  like  20mg.  Had  to  take  a  Valium  today  for  IMPENDING  ANXIETY  ATTACK,  but  that's  what  it's  there  for.  👌

__label__m _U  serious  question  do  you  know  anything    about  rubio's  adderall  use?
__label__m _U  Nonsense.  She  was  also  committing  an  offence  in  this  country  -  illegal  to  be  in  possession  of  tramadol  without  a  prescription.  She  knew  what  she  was  doing  -  probably  £5  a  tab  -  pay  for  her  holiday...  Also  ignorance  is  no  defence

__label__c _U  oxycodone  is  for  pain.  i  used  oxycodone  after  breaking  my  arm.  potential  masking  agent  limited  evidence  tho.  not  performance
__label__m _U  so  methadone  users  and  recovering  addicts  are  ok,  same  with  anti  psychotics,  anti  depressants,  and  all  other  man  made  drugs
__label__c you  know  that  feeling  when  you've  been  awake  longer  than  your  body  is  supposed  to  be  bc  of  adderall  and  you  can  feel  your  heart  overworking?

__label__m the  resident’s  hospice  nurse  is  the  one  that  increases  their  morphine  in  big  dosages  when  it’s  about  to  be  their  “time”.  The  family  of  the  residents  are  the  ones  that  ask  them  to  increase  it  subhanallah.  It’s  crazy.  But  we  only  give  morphine  as  a  PRN  med,  so  like  if  they  ask,  but
__label__m _U  got  no  beers  for  this  game,  a  bucket  of  Xanax  though

__label__m _U  #charliegard  parents  has  said  "...if  charlie  is  in  pain  why  no  morphine  given  to  him"    &  suddenly  he's  given  morphine......
__label__m _U  if  you  use  a  shit  load  of  adderall  you'd  probably  learn  it  a  lot  faster.
__label__c _U  it's  okay.  xanax.  since  i  was  15.  so  now  i  have  no  coping  skills,  and  they're  slowly  weaning  me  off  and  i'm  trying  to  learn  them  but....
__label__c I  am  currently  pinned  to  my  bed  with  back  pain,  but  NEED  breakfast.  Someone  send  food  and  morphine.  xoxo
__label__m _U  _U  _U  you  can  get  them  with  diazepam  in  them.
__label__c i  could  literally  make  myself  fall  asleep  for  4  days  with  the  amount  of  quetiapine  ive  been  prescribed,  tempting  extremely  tempting

I  probably  shouldn't  have  went  to  school  today  seeing  as  breathing  hurts  at  about  a  5  and  moving  bending  over  sitting  up  any  thing  like  that  is  easily  a  9."

__label__c _U  Valium  also  works.  That's  how  I  beat  my  polygraph.  LOL
__label__c tbh  i  was  scared  af.  then  they  start  to  prep  me  spinal  tap,  catheter,  and  morphine.  now  the  dr  walks  in  and  they  start  saying
__label__m _U  Nah.  Mrs  E  has  been  at  the  tramadol  and  is  spark  out  under  the  duvet  and  both  cats.  I've  got  a  rerun  of  an  AFL  game  from  earlier  this  evening  on  in  the  background  while  I  tweeple  watch  on  the  PC.
__label__a so  i  guess  i'm  the  friend  that  will  bring  a  ton  of  xanax  to  your  hospital  room  and  the  we  both  take  a  nice  nap.
__label__m _U  The  skeptic  in  me  thinks  they  realized  the  sales  force  was  poor  ROI.  Few  doctors  would  be  interested  in  meeting  with  OxyContin  reps.  Suspect  more  of  virtue  signaling

__label__m greetings  from  the  sky.  it's  pretty  bumpy,  wish  i  had  a  valium  😔

__label__c man  these  hydrocodone  pills  got  me  feeling  great  lmao
__label__m _U  _U  Then  make  methadone  available  to  those  hooked  on  opiods.
__label__m _U  it  wasnt  valium  it  was  some  opium  thing  boii
__label__m a  side  effect  of  adderall  is  uncontrollable  urges  to  get  a  mullet  &  collect  cb  radios.    it  all  makes  sense  now.
__label__m _U  klonopin  and  create?

__label__c _U  *smiles  at  you*  we  can  go  home  now.  seroquel  isn't  too  bad.  it  actually  works  really  well,  gee.
__label__m _U  You  don't  need  luck,  you  need  olanzapine.
__label__a Of  course,  all  opioids  can  cause  constipation.  But  you'd  need  to  take  quite  a  bit  of  Oxycodone  for  it  to  be  a  problem,  AFAIK.  I've  not  taken  it  that  much,  so  I  don't  know  how  bad  it  is.  But  it's  severe  with  Morphine  type  pain  meds.
__label__a does  anyone  know  how  dayquil  mixes  with  adderall
__label__m dorris  burke  drinking  lean  tonight??  xanax  maybe
__label__m This  humble  ass  man  came  up  to  me  outside  my  job  today  and  he  was  like  "excuse  me  sir,  do  you  have  the  time?"  And  i  really  thought  he  was  about  to  pull  out  a  fucking  scripture  or  something  but  then  he  goes  "i  gota  take  a  drug  test  for  suboxone  at  noon"  so  then  i  drug  tested  him
__label__m you'll  cowards  don't  even  snort  adderall
__label__c _U  red  bull  used  to  do  it  for  me,  but  my  doc  made  me  quit  caffeine  before  he  would  give  me  adderall  for  my  adhd.  he's  a  nazi.  😡
__label__a man  who  got  xanax  ,  hml  👌🏽
__label__c vyvanse  has  me  holding  a  30  minute  conversation  about  absolutely  nothing
__label__a i'll  never  forget  the  time  drunk  me  decided  it  was  a  good  idea  to  give  my  very  drunk  friend  clonazepam  so  she  could  sleep
__label__c _U  _U  _U  They  gave  me  valium  and  i  felt  nothing!

__label__m I’m  sure  they  mean  memory  loss  worse  than  the  memory  loss  due  to  many  prescriptions,    right?    (Gabapentin,  for  one!)    Big  Pharma  is  going  to  do  anything  they  can  to  stop  the  use  of  natural  products  for  healthcare  use.
__label__m _U  Tonight  he's  on  his  own.  It  will  come  undone.  No  TelePrompTer  or  Valium  to  keep  him  on  track
__label__a took  a  vyvanse  for  this  long  drive.  really  takes  me  back  to  pulling  all  nighters  in  college  #gallopgirlprobs
__label__a i  can't  wait  to  be  home  so  i  can  take  7  ativan  and  sedate  myself
__label__m oh  my  god  if  i  have  to  see  a  generation  of  kids  addicted  to  xanax  i'll  die.
__label__a happy  pills  and  adderall  #collegefreshmanadvice
__label__m The  total  amounts  of  seized  narcotics  during  the  month  of  (Dec-January  2018)  are  as  follow:  (77,  12)  Kg  of  Heroin.

__label__m “_U:  Correction  -  briefing  got  moved  to  3  pm  this  AM”    Enough  time  for  SHS  to  renew  her  Xanax  script.
__label__m _U  we  agree.  not  only  is  it  addictive,  the  withdrawals  are  mush  worse  from  suboxone
__label__c _U  _U  _U  can  you  reconcile  your  response  to  my  message?  Sorry,  I  forget  current  influence  of  codeine  &tramadol.
__label__c forget  how  much  i  missed  xanax  greatest  sleep  of  my  life
__label__m listeng  2  a  song  calld  adderall  &  the  chorus  is:  "adderall  we  gotta  take  it  all"  ovr&  over  again  &nothing  has  evr  resonated  w  me  so  strongly
__label__m _U  Abstinence  is  incredibly  difficult  but  possible.  Harm  reduction  medication  like  Suboxone  is  also  very  helpful  to  many.
__label__m To  all  you  people  who  hate  drugs  just  remember  if  there  was  no  such  thing  as  xanax  there  would  be  no  such  thing  is  lil  pump  so  xans  are  good
__label__m _U  tones  of  co-codamol/tramadol  out  there.  i  think  oxycodone  etc  less  so  here  than  in  the  us?
__label__c _U  _U  Paxil  and  Ativan  for  me!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  If  the  rumours  are  true  that  they  are  lined  up  to  come  over  I  may  need  some  Valium
__label__c i  got  my  adderall  appointment  on  4/20  too  😂😂😂😂😂😂  this  is  too  damn  funny
__label__a _U  _U  sorry  too  much  tramadol
__label__c i'm  finna  get  prescribed  adderall  😒😒
__label__c not  gonna  lie,  adderall  makes  me  a  happy  little  bee
__label__m _U  if  you  really  want  to  make  a  change,  make  suboxone  easier  to  get  for  everyone!  That  drug  is  a  life-saving,  life-changing  drug  for  addicts.  But  its  too  hard  for  most  to  get.
__label__c _U  I  take  the  generic.  Lorazepam.
__label__m _U  I  guess  repeated  references  to  meth,  meth  head,  methadone  (making  fun  of  addicts?)  and  face-shaming  someone  for  their  teeth  is  acceptable  to  body  shaming?  Who'd  have  known.  #documented  #onfile
__label__m _U  Thank  you  for  the  response,  hits  home.    He  was  in  ICU  for  only  23  hours,  walked  on  day  2,  and  his  pain  tolerance  is  incredible.    One  shot  of  morphine  that  was  it,  no  other  narcotics.    A  lot  of  chronic  pain  but  he  loves  his  life  and  is  fighting  hard  to  get  back.  🙏❤️

__label__m LRT  ADDERALL  ELITE
__label__c I  spent  the  past  72  hours  covered  in  sweat,  blood,  and  morphine.  No  context  is  needed.
__label__m _U  there  is  a  lot  of  hypocrisy,  legal  to  smoke  pot  but  not  tobacco.  oxycodone  easier  to  get  then  pot.  do  we  ban  all  "bad"  things
__label__c First  week  evaluation  of  being  in  hospital  as  an  adult.  Although,  kind  &  caring  the  NHS  is  most  definitely  overstretched,  having  a  tube  coming  out  of  my  belly  is  weird,  nurses  uniforms  aren't  as  stimulating  as  once  thought  &  morphine  is  wonderful  for  all  the  wrong  reasons!  😁🤒
__label__a the  comedown  of  vyvanse  got  me  fucked  up
__label__m _U  _U  Relax  Sally,  he  just  got  elected  leader  ,  take  a  Valium  or  a  midol,  and  relax
__label__a I  don't  need  no  speed,    I  don't  need  no  heroin,    I  don't  want  no  coke    You  can  keep  your  Ketamine.  Would  go  a  diazepam,  though.
__label__c finally  getting  my  vyvanse  filled  again!  so  happy  i  can  properly  function  now  #addprobs  💊💊💊
__label__c _U  _U  Ativan?  They’re  not  painkillers.  They’re  for  anxiety.  I  used  to  take  them.
__label__m anyone  else  think  #potus  is  heavily  sedated  on  xanax  2nite.  i  do  hope  so  because  that  prick  gives  me  plenty  of  anxiety  &  sleepless  nights
__label__c _U  How  about  buying  some  hemp  plant  oil  🌿💧!  CBD  oil  helped  reduce  my  anxiety  a  lot.  I  don't  even  need  my  xanax  now.  DM  me  for  more  info  about  it
__label__a Watching  a  documentary  on  pain  pill  addiction  as  I  go  pop  2  #oxycodone  aka  #percs  &  I  realize  how  addicting  they  can  be

__label__m _U  _U  I  cant  get  morphine  or  fentanyl  &  I  wont  have  em  4  extreme  pain  Politicians  have  MDs  now?
__label__c _U  didn't  take  my  adderall  today  :(
__label__c to  my  followers  who  suffer  with  bipolar  ~  i  feel  much  better  since  i  started  taking  my  mood  stabilisers  (  olanzapine  )  #bipolar  #depression
__label__u Idk  if  moniece  can  beat  Lyrica  ass..  but  I'm  here  for  the  fight  #LHHH
__label__c _U  taken  seroquel  prolong  for  6  years  now.  it  pretty  much  killed  all  my  creativity  but  my  social  anxiety  is  gone.
__label__a i  wonder  if  i  take  enough  xanax  ill  have  the  balls  to  actually  go  through  with  killing  myself
__label__c duty  doctor  has  decided  to  treble  the  dosage  of  quetiapine    from  tonight  as  he  wants  me  to  sleep.  it's  a  dosage  to  kill  a  fuckin  elephant  :(
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Toradol  isn't  even  a  narc...  morphine,  dilaudid  and  OxyContin  are  the  big  guns
__label__m _U  _U  Oxycontin  &  Fentanyl  should  be  banned  TODAY.  They  do  great  deal  of  damage  to  the  body  because  they  are  synthetic.  Accumulate  gradually  causing  OD.  Panadol  is  only  good  for  reducing  temperature  but  useless  for  pain.
__label__m _U  oooh.  zero  dark  thirty?  and  i'm  incredibly  pleased  you  take  zoloft.  effexor  &  klonopin  here,  baby!
__label__m The  Germans  were  pushed  back  at  the  gates  of  Moscow  because  they  ran  out  of  adderall  and  y'all  wanna  talk  about  cee-lo  Jordanopolous?
__label__c honestly  just  add  1.5  mg  of  ativan  to  my  daily  dose  of  medication  lol
__label__m someone  gave  me  a  xanax  and  i  literally  threw  it  down  a  drain  in  front  of  them  lol
__label__m _U  Thank  you.  When  Xanax  is  not  available,  puppy  GIFs  are  appreciated.
__label__m _U  I  know  he  wouldn't  take  it.  He  thought  the  valium  would  do  that  &  refused  to  take  it
__label__m _U  _U  Doesn't  methadone  affect  cardiac  rhythm  or  at  least  have  the  potential  to  do  so?
__label__c xanax  side  effects:      you  lose  the  part  of  your  brain  that  goes  "maybe  that's  enough  tweets  maybe  we  shouldn't  tweet  this"
__label__c vyvanse  rage  is  real  right  now  lol
__label__c _U  Shit  load  of  Tylenol  &  a  bit  of  oxycodone  tbh.  It's  dumb  lol
__label__m _U  vegetarian  and  english?  you're  just  problematic  all  around.  hope  you  take  a  few  extra  oxycontin  later(;
__label__c Ive  been  on  twitter  10  years.  But  today  is  my  first  as  part  of  the  _U  community  specifically.  I  have  had  the  best  time.  _U  _U    _U  and  _U  thanks  fellas,  appreciate  the  welcome.  But  the  Tramadol  have  won!  Night  all.#wearethecommunity
__label__a Eating  Xanax  like  chicken  nuggets,  now  that’s  a  bar  tender
__label__m _U  plus,  i'm  far  more  concered  with  fentanyl  and  oxycontin  and  the  fact  that  no  one  is  holding  big  pharma  to  account.
__label__m white  people  take  adderall  and  then  forget  how  to  speak  english
__label__m People  are  abuse'n  opiates  and  mixing  opiates  with  booze  and  sedatives  zanex,valium,and  others  that's  what's  causing  over  dose
__label__a also  going  on  a  date  is  vivid,  which  is  weird  because  i  was  on  the  most  xanax  then.
__label__m this  isnt  a  xanax  problem  its  a  fake  xanax  problem.
__label__m Do  I  need  tramadol  or  Advil?  That's  the  real  question.  😣😖😣😖😭😭
__label__u how  has  willies  'friend'  already  penned  a  diss  track?  who  is  safaree's  stylist?  lyrica  dancing  to  her  mums  music?  lyrica's  mums  face?
__label__m "Is  morphine  and  ket  a  dangerous  combo"  I'm  speechless
__label__m "all  i  had  to  eat  today  was  adderall  and  alcohol"  -dom  ❤️❤️❤️
__label__c i  just  thought  about  taking  an  adderall  and  cleaned  my  room  before  leaving  for  work
__label__c oh  and  if  it  is  tramadol  make  sure  youve  got  a  bathroom  on  demand  the  next  day  youre  gonna  need  it
__label__u _U  it  should  be  pretty  much  exactly  0,5cm  but  hm...  though,  i  think  last  time  i  sent  to  lyrica  it  was  still  less  than  3,xx?  hm...
__label__m _U  methadone  for  q  tip  addicts???
__label__m more  clothing  options  for  suburban  valium  mum:  lingerie  body  suits  &  black  robes  to  walk  around  in  while  i  am  in  my  valium  haze  peak
__label__a so  many  mixed  emotions  today.  i'm  so  drained.  i  need  to  smoke.  pop  a  xanax  and  pain  med.  just  want  this  to  be  over  need  feel  gone  for  bit
__label__m So  Trump  is  a  teapot.  A  pressure  cooker.  Do  you  need  xanax  and  some  tissue  until  your  nerves  settle?  You  little  snow  flake!
__label__m _U  she  was  glad  to  see  me!  they  gave  her  morphine  just  a  bit  ago.  we're  waiting  for  surgery  here  in  a  bit.
__label__m _U  _U  You  forgot  to  take  your  seroquel
__label__c _U  I'm  on  my  third  day  of  pregabalin  and  I  constantly  feel  dizzy  and  drunk.

It  does  help  some  ppl  with  their  pain-
__label__m _U  _U  Guess  Khloe  is  her  tramadol
__label__m _U  How  do  you  get  tired  after  taking  a  Vyvanse?
__label__m i  think  its  time  for  u  to  go  back  to  regular  seroquel  but  buzzard+
__label__m _U  That  is  one  dumbass  statement,  babs  take  a  valium
__label__m _U  no  not  xanax  take  a  teatcher  mmh  so  good
__label__m would  you  believe  me  if  i  said  i  never  popped  xanax
__label__u pam  and  lyrica  momma  like  erica  and  mandatory's  mother  😅😅😅
__label__m You  do  know  that  there  is  a  generic  version  of  Abilify,  right?  Aripiprazole.    Also,  do  you  know  about  GoodRX?  A  free  program  in  the  states  that  cuts  retail  prices  by  a  lot.  Apps  are  available  on  most  platforms.  (Also  free)  I've  found  that  it's  cheaper  than  insurance  copay!
__label__a when  this  girl  picked  me  up  when  i  was  walking  out  of  jail  still  fucked  up  off  the  xanax  i  knew  i  was  never  leaving
__label__m and  if  you're  getting  your  panties  in  a  twist  over  that  last  tweet,  remember  that  i  am  a  walking  'before'  example  in  an  alprazolam  advert.
__label__m “Don’t  take  adderall,  claritin  or  xanax  when  drinking  !”  “  one  of  those  is  not  like  the  others😂🤷🏻‍♀️”
__label__m _U  Do  you  consider  Xanax  a  drug?  If  so,  then  exercise  should  do  the  trick  instead
__label__a I  think  I  tried  to  kiss  _U  when  I  was  high  on  morphine  in  the  hospital.  I  really  don't  know  how  I  still  have  friends.
__label__c _U  I  got  off  adderal  and  started  Vyvanse,  you  don't  get  the  irregular  schedule  anymore,  you  just  become  incapable  of  eating.  Shits  the  worst
__label__m like  i  think  xanax  bars  have  destroyed  peoples  brains.  worthless  shit  stains  _U
__label__m _U  _U  _U  I  struggle  with  this  issue.  I  know  that  we  have  a  serious  problem  with  pain  medication  addiction  and  abuse.  I  have  no  experience  with  Kratom.

__label__m the  goal  is  to  create  music  that  will  wake  fiends  up  out  their  xanax  naps
__label__m _U  wtf?  xanax  and  methadone  to  get  off  of  that  other  shit?  wheres  that  special  clinic  at?
__label__m Tonight  I  met  a  teen  who  had  period  symptoms  so  intense  she  needed  morphine,  but  she  waited  to  come  in  until  after  her  volleyball  tryouts!!!
__label__m Ea  heeds  the  DEA  man  you  guys  have  gone  far  enough  with  this  psycho  hog  nose  vipering  "help"  and  insulin  cart  maggot  madness.  Get  your  shit  together  assholes.  #NoOne  can  dissolve  the  RICO  except  me.  Man  I  will  keep  fighting  for  it.  Scammy  medical  records  with  valium  absent.
__label__m _U  _U  agreed.  He  needs  Serequel...  Haldol,  and  probably  Librium.
__label__m When  I  dream  of  being  a  parent  I  imagine  looking  at  Emily  and  saying  with  exasperation  he  is  playing  that  music  so  damn  loud  and  some  of  my  adderall  seems  to  be  gone  and  where  the  fuck  are  all  of  my  motherfucking  David  Markson  books?

__label__m _U  Guessing  it  isn't  Xanax,  so  I'm  out.
__label__c _U  _U  Used  to  have  a  couple  a  day.  EFT  Tapping  has  helped.  CBD  oil  under  the  tongue.  And  when  all  else  fails,  klonopin.  The  sudden  untriggered  attacks  are  devastating  but  keep  holding  on.  It  will  pass.

I’ve  got  Diazepam.  I’m  doing  the  best  I  can,  but  it’s  not  enough.  I’ve  honestly  just  had  enough.  This  hurts  so  much  😢
__label__c just  to  clarify  i'm  actually  prescribed  to  adderall  for  my  add.  i'm  not  buyin  pills  on  the  low  low.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  There  is  some  very  damn  ignorant  people  on  this  thread  thinking  Cohen  and  Trump  are  going  down.  I  hope  the  pharmacies  have  plenty  of  valium  for  these  low  lives.

__label__c Mine  were  in  2007-And  I  remember  physicians  were  aggressively  pushing  Gabapentin  and  Cymbalta  like  they  were  the  cure-alls.  But  digging  deeper,  Gabapentin  seems  far  more  effective  when  given  with  opioids.  But  I  never  once  had  a  physician  tell  me  that.
__label__c _U  they're  a  bit  more  painful  since  yesterday  but  that's  probably  just  because  i  don't  have  morphine  at  home!

__label__a who  knows  anyone  that  has  adderall  need  them  for  legit  purposes
__label__m _U  _U  They  could  compensate  by  making  the  relatively  cheap  morphine  and  sell  it  to  all  the  third  world  hospitals  that  are  begging  out  for  it  rather  than  sitting  back  and  letting  America  push  really  expensive  and  addictive  OxyContin  on  them
__label__c _U  When  I  take  higher  dosages  of  patz  sl  +  clonazepam  I  get  SO  groggy  the  next  day  lol.  Patz  sl  kicks  in  really  fast,  except  if  I'm  not  already  in  bed  when  I  take  it.  And  yesss  animals  help  a  lot  &lt;3
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  This  ISN'T  bravery.  Lying  ISN'T  brave.  She  KNEW  he  was  an  addict  since  day  one.  She  said  that  he  relapsed  in  2009.  She  said  he  started  medicating  for  the  shoulder  pain  from  the  injury  he  received  (in  2013  btw)  a  year  before  his  death?  With  Ativan  for  pain?

__label__m _U  _U  _U  giving  children  oxycontin  is  crazy!!  the  same  drug  which  lead  most  people  to  heroin.  i  say  it's  crazy!!
__label__m _U  The  parents  job  is  sorta  over  at  16  for  many.  Those  suffering  get  access  to  it.  Why  does  it  need  to  be  legalized  recreationally?  Morphine  helps  sufferers  too.
__label__a recently  discovered  through  experimentation  that  xanax  nixes  my  #migraines.  stops  them  right  in  thr  tracks.  anyone  else  had  this  experience?

__label__a waaaay  too  much  codeine  and  adderral
__label__m Dey  say  support  your  own  but  as  I  hear  this  guy  say  Nigeria  don  win  this  #WorldCup  I  knew  it's  weed  added  to  tramadol  with  a  little  cocaine.
__label__m give    me  paper  towel  ,  give  me  another  valium  ,  give  me  another  hour  or  two  ...  hour  w/  you  😝
__label__m _U  _U  About  5  valium  a  day..
__label__m _U  _U  The  “opioid  crisis”  folks  have  no  understanding  that  some  people  are  on  these  meds  presumably  for  the  rest  of  their  lives.  Unless  Big  Pharma  comes  up  with  a  replacement  its  evil  Oxycontin  that  gives  some  people  their  lives  back.
__label__m I  just  popped  an  adderall,  im  not  mad  at  all  I'm  just  livin'

__label__c my  vyvanse  works  way  better  than  this  shit
__label__m also  is  there  ANY  recourse  for  suing  the  makers  of  OxyContin  or  what

__label__m _U  _U  _U  I'll  tell  you  this.  I  have  a  C-4  neck  injury  that  left  me  a  quadriplegic.  Sometimes  I  go  through  serious  pain.  When  I  asked  my  Dr.  for  Oxycodone,  she  told  me  they're  very  addictive.  I  declined.  Now  I  just  smoke  weed!
__label__a _U  _U  _U  I'd  enjoy  that!  I  will  be  at  the  Battery  for  a  bit  then  in  South  Park.  I  am  going  to  take  a  fistful  of  valium  before  I  leave
__label__c _U  Hell,  my  body  resists  sleep  even  when  it  absolutely  shouldn't  (like  after  10mg  of  Ambien  and  1mg  Klonopin  😬)
__label__c this  vyvanse  has  got  me  uuuuuupppp.  my  fingers  hurt  too  much  to  play  doe😔
__label__a I  don't  know  how  you  people  can  do  Adderall.  Meth  is  less  intense.  At  least  I  can  fall  asleep  and  get  a  hard  dick  on  that.

__label__c _U  i  took  a  pill  of  xanax  in  latina
__label__m _U  gabapentin  is  usually  not  enough  alone  to  control  pain  and  that  is  why  gabapentin  is  usually  added  to  tramadol,  methocarbamol
__label__m _U  Good  for  you.  Bet  the  exercise  helps.  Bit  cold  here  but  Im  chomping  at  the  bit  to  get  out  and  about  when  it  warms  up.  I  need  heat  for  my  body  to  work.  I  remember  my  mum  and  her  mates  all  had  valium  in  the  70s.  Easy  to  get  as  the  pill  back  then.
__label__a adderall  doesn't  ruin  lives.  try  and  tell  me  i'm  "addicted"  to  adderall  as  i  hand  you  a  handmade  popsicle  stick  replica  of  the  eiffel  tower.

__label__m _U  Setting  up  shooting  up  safe  zones  for  drug  addicts  is  not  a  great  way  to  promote  your  city.  You  will  be  promoting  &  facilitating  many  deaths.  What  has  proven  somewhat  successful  in  Portugal  &  Canada  is  setting  up  methadone  centers  along  with  rehabilitation  although  not  ideal.

__label__m _U  Take  a  Xanax  and  wash  it  down  with  a  shot  of  vodka.  Drug  dealers  and  human  traffickers  are  animals  to  most  sane  people.  How  many  children  have  been  rescued  and  saved  by  border  agents?  But,  you  don’t  care.

__label__m If  Trump  wants  to  threaten  drug  dealers  with  the  death  penalty  does  that  extend  to  the  pharmaceutical  companies  who  lie  about  the  addictive  properties  of  their  drug?      Asking  for  Purdue  Pharma,  the  folks  who  created/lied  about  OxyContin
__label__c MiL’s  just  left.  She  stayed  about  an  hour  &  a  half.  I’m  now  back  to  feeling  incredibly  anxious  again.  I’ve  got  Diazepam  if  I  need  it.  I’m  not  sure  what  to  do  with  myself  now.  Please  don’t  cry.  Please  don’t  cry.  Please  don’t  cry.

__label__a "i  don't  have  a  personality  so  i  do  what  rappers  talk  about  to  fit  in."  *pops  xanax  and  sips  lean*
__label__m It  looks  like  time  is  being  wasted  on  this  issue  because  i  think  by  now  TRAMADOL  should  have  been  banned  from  pharmacies  and  other  areas  where  it  can  be  acquired  just  like  Nigeria.  It's  bad  to  see  some  of  our  colleagues  abuse  the  drug  and  do  all  sort  of  things.😭😭😭  _U

__label__m _U  yes.  humming,  dizzy  on  the  comedown,  diazepam  are  also  my  favorites  on  that  album
__label__a _U  _U  I’m  not  sure,  really.  We  rely  so  heavily  on  pharma  -  it  will  take  a  hella  shift  to  see  that  ALL  drugs  that  alter  you  CAN  be  dangerous  if  not  taken  responsibly  -  I  had  a  friend  whose  doc  prescribed  her  400mg  of  oxycodone  a  day  -  after  2  yrs,  she  found  herself  over  using...

__label__m What’s  unconstitutional  about  banning  semi-automatic  &  automatic  weapons?  That’s  like  saying  it’s  unconstitutional  to  make  cocaine  &  heroine  illegal  because  OxyContin  &  Percocet  are  legal.  No  one  is  going  after  2nd  amendment  rights  to  OWN  guns,  it’s  banning  guns  NO  ONE  should  own

__label__a This  is  all  very  interesting.  My  mom  committed  suicide  using  opiates  and  benzos.  I'm  going  into  rehab  for  Xanax  addiction  later  this  month  and  they'll  be  using  Suboxone  and  naloxone  to  help  me  get  through  the  withdrawal.  Makes  me  wonder  if  I'm  trading  one  addiction  for  another.
__label__a airdrop  me  an  adderall.
__label__m quit  fucking  with  lean  and  xanax  if  you  wanna  get  high  smoke  weed  you  idiots
__label__c adderall  got  me  feeling  like  i  could  drink  this  case  by  myself
__label__c _U  Thanks  to  bad  the  morphine  is  wearing  off  and  I  can  feel  life  again
__label__m _U  _U  winners  get  a  fifth  of  rum  and  a  bottle  of  oxycontin
__label__m ever  feel  like  there's  just  not  enough  xanax  in  the  world?..
__label__c Hurting  like  a  S.O.B.!  Gave  me  a  shot  of  morphine  5  hours  ago,  didn't  do  a  damn  thing  for  me.  😭
__label__m "the  only  thing  about  xanax  is  that  it  makes  you  not  give  a  fuck"  -my  dad
__label__m sext:  let  me  be  your  valium
__label__m do  you  understand  how  hard  it  is  to  check  indirects  when  1)  "Ad"  is  used  for  "advertisement"  and  2)  "Addy"  is  used  for  "address"  or  "Adderall"
__label__c _U  you  do  when  your  xanax  is  kicking  in.
__label__c when  i  take  vyvanse  it  literally  makes  me  hate  everyone  so  i'm  sorry
__label__a Fuckkkk  it.  225mg  of  seroquel  it  is  tonight.  letttttts  go  into  the  slumber.
__label__a i  guess  i'm  the  adderall  connect?    😂
__label__m Sure,  dr’s  aren’t  immune  to  misinfo  either.  I  had  to  explain  to  a  Dr.  here  ~2005  that  they  were  giving  bad  info  pt’s  being  told  initiation  on  subutex  b4  switch  to  suboxone  was  bc  the  naloxone  causes  precipitated  withdrawal,  which  it  doesn’t,  the  bupe  itself  does  that...1/2
__label__m What  is  the  future  when  all  the  youths  do  best  is  smoke  away  their  visions,  burn  away  energy  with  tramadol,  shortened  their  life  in  blood  covenanted  cult,  end  their  story  in  robbery  cos  of  quick  money,  while  some  ladies  feel  every  rich  man'  should  transfer  cash  into  their  account
__label__m _U  is  that  the  hoe  next  to  you  on  adderall  ?  that  bitch  act  like  she  on  sumn  regardless  .
__label__c Im  still  not  tired  and  I  took  2.5  mg  of  ativan  wtf
__label__m so  this  lyrica  is  an  illegal  drug  lol.
__label__m "i  know,  baby."  i  can't  even...  i'm  just  going  to  take  a  handful  of  valium  and  wait  til  all  the  feels  are  gone.  #wayhaught  #wynonnaearp
__label__m weed  to  keep  me  mellow  scary  drugs  to  turn  me  black  morphine  for  energy  prozac  to  force  a  smile  depakote  for  sickness  abilify  to  die
__label__m adderall  or  naw
__label__c adderall  got  me  brushin'  my  teeth  so  hard,  my  gums  are  bleeding  #enrgi
__label__c Ok  took  some  Valium  panic  attacks  were  just  too  severe  to  handle.  Those  dreams  were  too  brutal
__label__a percocets  and  the  codeine  got  me  floatingg
__label__m _U  Has  any  maintenance  program  alone  EVER  been  enough  ?  Why  would  MAT  with  suboxone  be  enough  ?
__label__m Im  mad  im  a  human  secretly  bernie  sanders,  so  we  must  take  action  and  begin    LIGHT  THE  FUSE  MY  DUDE  DETONATE  THE  xanax  the  nerve  of  some  people
__label__a somebody  has  xanax  plz  ?
__label__m _U  because  nausea  is  such  an  issue  with  suboxone
__label__a xanax  and  codiene  gon  be  the  death  of  me....
__label__m i  need  a  bucket  of  coffee  and  a  shot  of  morphine  after  that  phone  call...  absolute  cannon!  🙄
__label__m seroquel  n  having  me  😴😴😴
__label__m I  had  no  idea  heroine  was  a  form  of  morphine  .  Lol
__label__m _U  but  those  might  interfere  with  the  kids  xanax,  prozac,  ritalin  in  or  adderall  hahahahahah
__label__c adderall  had  me  like  wut
__label__a im  so  fucked  up  off  adderall  writing  an  essay  for  I  don’t  know  whom  but  somebody  gone  read  this  shit
__label__c i  need  to  take  adderall  to  remember  if  i've  taken  my  adderall  or  not  #adhdproblems
__label__c _U  my  fucking  nerves  are  shattered  and  that's  with  me  on  valium  😂
__label__m thanks  to  lyrica  hahaha
__label__m _U  Go  first  class,  and  take  diazepam.  Simple.
__label__m colege  girls  love  alcohol  and  poppen  adderall
__label__m _U  Perhaps  they  needed  their  morphine!
__label__m on  the  block  i'm  magical  see  me  at  ya  college  campus  baggy  full  of  adderall
__label__m So  traumatic  And  I'm  manic    Feeling  panicked  I  need  a  Xanax
__label__c ::opens  computer,  takes  a  Valium,  looks  through  app  reviews  to  find  the  ones  that  aren’t  grown  men  asking  for  Sports  to  be  a  safe  space::
__label__m #facupfinal  _U  needs  a  dose  of  valium  #tempertantrum
__label__m black  friday  is  adderall  season
__label__m Next  time,I'll  make  sure  to  take  some  Valium  on  thursday  at  night.
__label__c Over  6  months  now  since  I  got  off  #Methadone  omg  #recovery  is  possible!  These  past  6  months  have  been  hell  sometimes  but  I’m  so  grateful  to  be  off  that  stuff  now.
__label__c saphris  had  me  fucked  up  for  17  hours.  not  taking  that  shit  again,  idgaf  is  my  psych  gets  mad  .  😖
__label__c took  some  oxycodone  and  i  feel  great
__label__m _U  _U  jules  don't  worry  about  what  a  psycho  who  probably  just  too  much  xanax  and  thought  about  how  terrible  her
__label__m XANAX,  disney  things,  velvet  dresses,  carnations,  citrus  fruits
__label__c can  this  oxycodone  kick  in
__label__m my  advisor  basically  told  me  to  take  a  xanax  and  that  college  has  turned  me  into  a  monster  lolololol
__label__m "Can't  walk  out  the  house  and  forget  my  strap  all  these  Xanax  and  I  still  can't  lack"
__label__m vinyl  and  valium
__label__a you  ever  just  have  a  good  ugly  cry  that's  been  building  for  days  and  then  take  like....20  xanax  in  hopes  of  feeling  less.    yeah,  me  neither.
__label__c _U  _U  give  me  back  my  adderall  doc
__label__m guys  i  didn't  know  the  cliche  was  true  i  keep  getting  offered  adderall  hahaha  #asu
__label__c Right  now  is  a  hot  season  for  bipolar  flair  bears  like  me  to  go  off  &  go  insane.  I  had  a  week  in  Ψhospital  &  5mgs  daily  of  valium  +  zyprexa
__label__c _U  Gabapentin...  It  works  like  Zoloft  did  for  me  but  it  didn't  give  me  panic  attacks.  It  is  a  great  medication  and  you  likely  won't  have  to  go  to  a  psychiatrist  to  get  it  like  you  may  with  SSRIs
__label__m Waarschijnlijk  iets  in  de  richting  van      'wow  the  anxiety  is  through  the  roof  get  some  valium  helen'    en    'you  may  have  autism'
__label__a now  i  remember  why  i  got  into  xanax  and  thats  bc  its  like  being  drunk  (eh)  but  you  get  the  effect  15  times  quicker
__label__a Oh  ffs  I  need  like  100mg  of  Valium  to  ease  my  anxious  state  can’t  cope  why  do  I  take  uppers  then  downers  then  uppers  then  downers  my  brain  feels  weird  hashtag  soft  core  drug  induced  elation
__label__c _U  _U  Chronic  neuropathic  pain  from  shingles  here.  Please  fight  these  ill  informed  politicians  who  will  cause  massive  suffering  from  lack  of  oxycodone  which  i  rely  on  (80mg  perbday)  .1  million  a  yr  will  get  shingles.  Your  info  included  is  thorough  and  true.  Opioids  save  lives
__label__m probably  most  of  the  research  studies  and  theses  done  by  college  students  are  because  of  adderall
__label__a _U  My  advice  is  to  trade  for  xr  Adderall  and  just  boof  them  on  the  flight  as  necessary
__label__a _U  _U  my  neighbor  was  a  gay  black  xanax  dealer.  lovely  days
__label__c _U  one  time  i  accidentally  got  put  on  seroquel  by  my  doctor  and  the  pharmacy  put  "take  2  each  morning"  on  it;  that  was  a  time!
__label__c _U  I  had  Xanax  and  all  was  well  haha
__label__m SLC  gotta  Xanax  problem    2018  we  poppin’  Tic  Tac’s    and  Flintstone  gummies
__label__c _U  it's  like  adderall  haha  instead  of  adderall  they  gave  me  vyvanse
__label__m if  choices  define  the  essence  of  capitalism.  let  me  eat  my  cake  but  just  not  at  3  am.  zyprexa  has  killed  many  thru  hpb/heartd  $itci  _U
__label__m “and  i’m  tweaking  off  adderall”  lmfaooooooo
__label__a i  need  a  damn  can  of  dry  shampoo  and  a  bottle  of  adderall  if  i'm  about  to  survive  these  parties  tonight
__label__c i  haven't  taken  my  vyvanse  in  a  month  yet  all  i  want  to  do  lately  is  be  productive.  i'm  not  complaining  but  i  don't  know  what's  happening...
__label__m #ukog  -  a  real  valium  RNS,  anti-anxiety  to  soothe  nerves.  Flowing  and  results  by  end  of  month.  Nice!  SS  answered  most  of  operation  Q's    😀
__label__a i  have  2  papers  to  write  this  weekend  man,  probably  gonna  pull  all  nighters.  you  tryin  to  slide  some  adderall  my  way?  _U
__label__a _U  2  xanax  and  6  beers  is  my  preflight  routine.    after  that  they  could  do  barrel  rolls  and  i  would  hardly  notice
__label__a Jack  Daniels...  cap  of  Valium  mixed  with  antidepressants  👌🏾
__label__m _U  strategy,  crush  up  some  lorazepam  and  give  it  to  lowry  incrementally  until  he  settles  down
__label__c My  tolerance  for  sedatives  is  obscene.  I  just  took  klonopin,  melatonin,  and  anti-allergy  meds  and  I'm  *hoping*  for  at  least  6  hours  of  sleep.
__label__m fuck  your  selfies.  you're  nothing  but  a  walking  xanax  bar.  you're  really  not  cute.  stop  it.
__label__m _U  don't  get  me  started  on  morphine,  I  knew  someone  who  literally  walked  around  drinking  it  out  of  a  Capri  sun  bottle
__label__m i  need  some  muthafuckin  sleep  or  adderall  like
__label__m I  think  washing  down  xanax  with  coffee  is  a  lil  counterintuitive  🤔
__label__m percocet  n  codeine  please  don't  take  my  liiiiifeeee
__label__a i'm  so  done  with  these  questions  my  face  hurts  and  i  had  3  adderall  bye
__label__u _U  right  here~  *pulls  lyrica  in  close  and  gives  her  a  deep  kiss  on  the  lips*
__label__c this  is  a  public  service  anouncement.  do  not  take  vyvanse  if  you  are  hungover.  it  is  not  a  fun  time.  carry  on.
__label__a Do  I  neck  diazepam  for  a  day  and  either  go  to  deep  sea  world  or  the  zoo
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Ja  m'he  empassat  trankimazin,  paroxetina,  diazepam,i  estic  dels  nervis
__label__m The  employees  at  Moe's  in  Dayville  look  like  the  cast  of  a  musical  about  a  methadone  clinic
__label__c four  days  back  home  was  splendid.  fours  of  sleep  during  the  entire  time  was  not.  valium  and  a  🍷  can't  come  quick  enough.
__label__c Them  Xanax  took  me  out  yesterday
__label__m Tell  that  bitch  get  them  xanax  out  my  face
__label__m Swear  fo’  god  I  hate  driving  down  Kirkman  😡😤🤬  you  either  need  to  pop  a  Xanax  or  smoke  a  bowl  before  you  attempt  driving  down  this  fuck  ass  road!
__label__m just  pop  a  valium  hope  that  helps
__label__m _U  Yeah,  when  Sniper  Wolf  shoots  you,  your  character  spins  out  of  control.  Diazepam  basically  makes  you  aim  your  gun  straight,  it's  kind  of  impossible  without  it.
__label__m "I  know  ppl  who  took  adderall  and  they  were  like  zombies"  Okay  but??  There  are  many  different  meds  now??  And  not  all  of  them  work  the  same?
__label__c _U  _U  Years  ago,  they  refused  to  fill  a  prescription  for  me  for  Klonopin,  citing  their  status  as  "a  check  on  the  doctors."  Direct  quote.
__label__m _U  XANAX  ADDICTION  SHAJAJ
__label__m You  know  what  I  hate  about  the  song?  The  heroine  morphine  part,  the  key  it  self  ..  I  just  don’t  like  it
__label__m _U  *puts  himself  on  a  morphine  iv  as  his  veins  started  bulging  out*
__label__m That  bitch  told  me  meet  her  at  the  methadone  clinic
__label__m _U  _U  I  agree,  but  Mr.  Hitchens,  who  I  respect  a  lot,  revealing  a  bias  by  focusing  on  the  drug/diazepam  aspect
__label__c the  taste  of  clonazepam  makes  me  happy
__label__m never  fcking  take  a  xanax
__label__c _U  fk  it  i'm  taking  the  oxycodone  i  was  given  for  my  kidney  stones.  snek  if  i  die  i'm  blaming  it  on  your  poor  advice  to  get  to  gold
__label__m in  other  news  i'm  giving  my  puppy  a  higher  dose  of  tramadol  than  i  have  given  some  of  my  patients  😅
__label__c _U  It’s  horrible  to  live  with...  I’m  38  and  was  diagnosed  with  arthritis  at  34!!!  I  have  morphine  twice  a  day  just  so  I  can  move  around  for  the  day....  but  I  also  have  osteoporosis  too
__label__u But  seriously  Lyrica  you  look  dumb  girl  let  your  man  get  that  paper  !  #LHHH
__label__m _U  thanks!  she  seemed  to  very  much  enjoy  spacing  out  on  morphine  last  weekend  though,  and  good  news,  she's  all  better  now  :)
__label__m #AHSCult  Ally  you  need  a  nice  glass  of  wine,  and  some  Xanax.  It's  going  to  be  alright  girl.
__label__m _U  _U  Shut  up  methadone  prick
__label__c Have  now  realized  Ultram/Tramadol  affects  my  mental  wellbeing  day  after  taking.
__label__m ._U  _U  so  all  the  prozac  addict  south  bay  mommies  feeding  their  kids  ritalin    is  fine,  but  a  plant  isn't?  #hypocrites
__label__c _U  lol  when  i  was  ran  over  i  slept  with  a  wrap  around  pregnancy  pilliow  and  ate  hydrocodone  like  candy.
__label__c _U  It’s  my  first  ever  but  I’m  not  gunna  be  asleep.  They  are  giving  me  4  Ativan.  Numbing  needles,  and  laughing  gas  I’m  gunna  die!  Lol
__label__m _U  Just  feel  better  dear...  Why  are  you  in  Hospital?  The  Morphine  will  help  you  though,  that  is  a  nice  little  cocktail.
__label__a i  want  som  xanax  :(((
__label__m _U  just  burst  your  fav  Xanax  rapper's  bubble  so  casually  #1985  #KOD
__label__c _U  yeah  I  took  some  klonopin  and  slept  for  a  while  :o
__label__m _U  _U  But  if  you  give  APAP  and  then  need  morphine  at  minute  61...  you  lose.  At  least  the  way  my  abstractors  play.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  You  are  saying  they  trade  the  suboxone  for  like  cocaine  or  something?
__label__m _U  Just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine  Suddenly,  I'm  a  fiend  and  you're  all  I  need  All  I  need,  yeah,  you're  all  I  need  It's  you,  babe  And  I'm  a  sucker  for  the  way  that  you  move,  babe
__label__m prettiest  girl  i  ever  seen  didn't  know  you  had  a  thing  for  the  morphine
__label__m oxycontin  in  known  as  'hillbilly  heroin'  in  the  states.  it's  just  as  addictive  and  easier  to  overdose  on
__label__m That  fking  scumbag  was  just  down  here  at  a  “no  press  allowed”  local  Republican  chapter  dinner.  I  thought  he  was  just  doing  the  circuit  again  to  raise  money  for  his  lawyers,  which  still  may  be  in  part  true.  But  makes  me  wonder.    He’s  like  a  lot  of  them,  take  away  his  OxyContin.
__label__m i  also  think  this  is  more  than  just  xanax  ..
__label__a that  moment  when  adderall  becomes  the  gateway  to  passing  class...
__label__c _U  _U  Yes  David  I  sympathise  with  Samantha,  I  had  to  withdraw  from  Venlafaxin,  Seroquel  and  Lithium-all  at  the  same  time.  There  was  no  support.  I  really  don't  want  Samantha  to  go  through  what  I  had  to  experience.  Appreciate  your  good  work.
__label__c Tramadol  won’t  let  me  sleep...  so  what  does  my  brain  do,  Overthink!!      Ever  wonder  if  someone  doesn’t  really  want  you,  but  to  afraid  to  let  you  go  🤦🏻‍♀️
__label__m let  the  adderall  requests  begin
__label__a adderall  &  red  bull  #friday
__label__c _U  You'd  be  astounded  at  how  long  I  can't  fight  my  meds  for  -  I've  been  on  Quetiapine  for  6  years.
__label__a One  of  these  days  I’m  gonna  actually  take  the  adderall  I  have  and  the  Zech  you  all  know  will  be  no  more.
__label__m "I  want  to  put  twice  songs  in  the  dj  booth,  lmao."    -  Xanax
__label__c My  doctor  prescribed  the  wrong  MF  to  adderall  lemme  tell  ya
__label__c I  actual  hate  having  a  bad  day  and  having  to  take  diazepam  cause  it  always  reacts  with  my  amytryptaline  and  makes  me  so  drowsy  and  sick  😭😭
__label__c _U  when  i  was  15  they  gave  me  oxycodone  for  an  ear  infection.  true,  i  was  bleeding  from  the  ear.  but  it  had  me  in  withdrawal.
__label__m I  wonder  if  we  took  all  the  Prozac  and  Xanax  in  the  world....  crushed  it  up  and  let  the  wind  take  it...  if  it’d  help  Mother  Nature  get  her  ass  in  check?!?  No  seriously...  GET  IT  together  girl!  🧐🤔🤨😏🤞🏽

__label__m _U    adderall  had  a  chick  at  arby's  smoking  my  meat  for  10  hours.
__label__c I  don't  condone  Xanax  but  now  I'm  taking  them,    I'm  a  hypocrite
__label__m She’s  morphine,  queen  of  my  vaccines  🎵
__label__c i  don't  care  for  xanax  anymore.      proud  to  say  that.      :-)  :-)  :-)
__label__m opioids  have  the  most  risk  for  addiction  but  no  neurotoxicity.  even  amphetamines  like  adderall  have  more  neurological  damage.  fucking  crazy.
__label__c its  that  damn  abilify  once  that  shit  wheres  off  it  get  its
__label__m under  no  circumstance  should  adderall  be  your  friend  #lame
__label__m ._U  this  seems  like  one  for  you  rt  _U:  which  wine  goes  best  with  adderall  and  cheetos
__label__c the  only  good  thing  that  came  out  of  my  knee  getting  fucked  up  again  is  the  fact  they  gave  me  oxycodone  🌚
__label__c _U  _U  more  like  "when  the  oxycodone  hit  and  you  strugglin  to  stay  awake"
__label__m _U  its  sick  man-btw  the  suboxone  pill  they  pulled  up  was  the  2nd  pill-the  1st  is  a  cross&they  have  removed  pics  from  online  #digdeep
__label__m Trudeau  providing  400000  for  more  methadone  clinics  across  the  country.
__label__m _U  I’m  disappointed  by  the  lack  of  Ativan  defence.
__label__m _U  bru  i  love  you  guys  but  be  real  you  know  amphetamines  doesn't  =  meth.  adderral,  mdma,  etc.,
__label__c adderall  has  me  ready  to  post  all  six  selfies  in  my  selfie  album
__label__m jane  is  on  a  shit  load  of  valium  and  cannabis    #fourinabed
__label__m _U  Clonazepam  prescribed  by  a  non-neurologist  =  likely  induces  (massive)  seizures  In  combination  with  other  drugs  =  other  serious  side  effects  and  possible  death
__label__a adderall  is  my  bff  when  it  comes  to  studying.
__label__u _U  _U  I  think  that  would  be  a  great  drag  name  “Lyrica  divine”..
__label__m "The  label  for  OxyContin  declared,  “  ‘Addiction’  to  opioids  legitimately  used  in  the  management  of  pain  is  very  rare.”  “There  is  no  evidence  that  addiction  is  a  significant  issue  when  persons  are  given  opioids  for  pain  control.”    #mnleg  you  need  to  re-educate  providers/public
__label__m _U  She's  so  crazy  haha  she  needs  a  xanax
__label__m His  wife  had  gotten  spined,  and  Cotter  had  to  administer  morphine  for  the  intense  pain.
__label__c _U  i  got  off  morphine  almost  8  months  ago.  your  skin  will  ❤  u  and  your  liver  will  too.  stay  strong.  mentally  it's  f'n  hell
__label__m so  the  next  line  of  high  stool  tennis  will  be  all  about  "work".  what!  in  your  houses?  apologies!  but  there  isn't  enough  valium  in  the  world.
__label__c field  work  finished,  everyone  happy.  morphine  for  the  trapped  nerves,  wrap  up  a  week  from  monday.  first  billion  dollar  project.  fuck  yeah.
__label__a I  have  an  opening  shift  and  almost  cried  when  I  found  I  had  one  last  adderall  left  god  is  good
__label__a I  need  a  smoke  and  a  Xanax  after  watching  this
__label__a So  much  Xanax  my  arms  are  on  a  ten  second  delay.

__label__a Chewing  adderall  was  literally  the  worst  decision  I've  ever  made  in  my  life
__label__c does  anyone  on  quetiapine  feel  numb/empty?  i  get  this  and  wonder  if  i'm  better  without  it,  but  at  the  same  time  it  does  have  it's  positives.
__label__c friday  nite  in  with  a  some  ribena,  a  mint  aero,  a  trapped  nerve,  some  tramadol,  diazepam  &  the  bodyguard.  it  doesn't  get  wilder  than  this  😆
__label__m Had  the  trippiest  dream  last  night  that  i  was  popping  xanax  in  school  and  i  believe  the  dream  acc  made  me  high  off  xanax  while  i  was  sleep
__label__m #np  Methadone  -  Rise  Against
__label__a _U  more  like  hand  me  the  xanax  while  you  mix  me  a  whiskey.
__label__m _U  Wow  take  some  suboxone  bro
__label__m In  #Lebanon  as  in  #Europe,  Christianity’s  resistance  must  start  with  awareness  on  all  levels:  cultural,  political  and  spiritual.  Dare  to  call  things  by  their  name  and  reject  the  morphine  of  political  correctness  #BarJulius  #TurLevnon  #Maronites
__label__m _U  Sending  hugs  &  chewable  morphine  too!  Head  colds  are  just  UGH.
__label__m "i  have  to  see  my  aunt  tomorrow  i  need  xanax  so  badly"
__label__c Hey  guys,  I  hope  everyone  is  doing  all  right.    My  pain  is  improved,  managing  my  pain  with  my  pain  meds,  just  suffering  quite  a  bit  from  anxiety.    The  busbar  my  psychiatrist  put  me  on  in  conjunction  with  my  diazepam  doesn't  seem  to  be  doing  anything.    The  former,  that  is.
__label__c complained  about  pain,  and  the  dude  gave  me  120  oxycodone  10s.
__label__c When  psychologist  asked  me  about  narcotics,  I  immediately  thought  about  the  morphine  the  doc  gave  me  when  I  was  hemorrhaging.
__label__m _U  _U  I  understand  that  but  I'm  not  saying  to  cut  people  off  their  medication  abruptly.  I'm  saying  that  they  Are  prescribing  way  more  than  what  is  needed.  It  seems  as  if  they  don't  understand  what  the  equivalent  is  for  say  suboxone  to  heroin  or  oxy.
__label__c you'd  think  i'd  be  able  to  hack  morphine  sulphate  tabs,  given  that  i  was  taking  80mg/day  for  five  weeks
__label__m xanax  and  brownies
__label__u I  dreamt  that  I  went  to  NY  w  _U  and  we  met  Lyrica  and  Christy  and  we  talked  for  a  while  and  she  signed  our  playbills  and  now  I'm  sad  it's  never  gonna  come  true  :(

__label__m _U  Forgot  to  take  his  Xanax?
__label__a Took  something  like  7mg  of  Lorazepam  yesterday.  It’s  been  rough.
__label__u Please  remind  me  to  never  go  to  Woodrow  and  Princeton  games  w/  lyrica🙁
__label__m _U  _U  No  we  should  make  big  pharma  fund  substance  abuse  treatment  centers  for  heavily  marketing  OxyContin  to  Drs  and  hospitals  and  covering  up  the  addictive  properties  of  the  painkillers  they  pedal  that  have  exacerbated  the  drug  problem  we  have.  Next.
__label__c Had  a  minor  anxiety  attack.  Took  my  Ativan  at  8:30p.  Just  woke  up  at  1am.  Seriously?  Looks  like  I'll  be  up  a  fecking  night.
__label__m _U  should  be  big  news  in  the  USA    -South  Carolina  sues  OxyContin  maker  Purdue  over  opioid  marketing  -  About  time!!!!!
__label__m guy  next  to  me  on  adderall  or  some...
__label__c this  is  so  much  worse  than  labour,  even  morphine  isn't  helping  anymore  i'm  literally  fuckibg  done
__label__m some  guy  just  asked  me  if  i  wanted  to  buy  adderall  💀
__label__m _U  I’m  sorry.  Man,  it  sucks  when  we  feel  we’ve  exhausted  all  options.  Hmmm.  Have  you  tried  Seroquel?  I’ve  heard  good  things  about  that  one.  Or  some  sort  of  mood  stabilizer  like  Epival?  I  feel  for  you.  I’m  in  the  same  type  of  situation.  💜
__label__m my  class  tried  pranking  the  teacher  into  thinking  this  one  kid  was  overdosing  on  xanax  and  it  was...such  a  fail.....im  embarrassed.........
__label__c at  the  pharmacy  to  pick  up  my  ativan  because  i  have  a  date  and  i  fucking  need  it  lmao
__label__m who  doesn't  drink  a  few  glasses  of  🍷every  day  Fuck  Methadone
__label__m Risprone  (antiparkinsonian)  Used  recreationally  for  rising  Decreases  the  rock-loving  effects  of  quetiapine
__label__c free  advice:  don't  take  seroquel  unless  you  plan  on  sleeping  almost  immediately  after  you  take  it.  really  messed  you  up  man.
__label__m i  saw  some  states  at  leeds  fest  but  none  were  as  funny  as  the  woman  next  to  me  out  of  her  mind  on  morphine  hahaha
__label__m my  cousins  called  me  in  darayya  4  years  ago  they  said  "can  you  get  food  in?"  i  said  no.  he  said  "can  you  at  least  get  morphine  in  1/2
__label__m _U  _U  I  worked  for  a  Fortune  500  pharmaceutical  company  for  four  years.  They  absolutely  deceptively  promoted  opiods  for  years.  When  OxyContin  first  came  out  they  tried  to  claim  it  was  LESS  addictive.  They  didn't  realize  ppl  were  going  2B  cooking  &  shooting  it  up.
__label__a Should  I  use  Tramadol  in  training,  or  just  racing?  _U
__label__c _U  _U  adderall  had  me  make  sure  that  he  counted  850  marks  correctly
__label__c adderall  had  me  having  a  heart  to  heart  with  a  random  on  instagram.  😍😅🎀
__label__m _U  Valium  should  be  cheap  as  candy  by  now.
__label__m Acquire  big  number  of  "examining  kits"  for  such.  Ask  all  MLAs  to  give  blood-urine  samples  before  1:00,  analayze  them  and  debar  them  to  take  voting.    Check  for    -  Non-prescribed  opiates  (Ganja,  Heroin,  etc).  -  Non-prescribed  mood  altering  agents  (Valium,  Anxit,  etc).  -  Alcohol.
__label__a lmao  Betty  gave  me  Valium  I'm  so  fucked  uo  atm  lmao
__label__c Do  any  of  my  Twitter  pals  have  tips  for  managing  chronic  pain  on  bad  days?  Tramadol  and  heat  pack  and  trying  to  relax  and  fancy  facial  oil  massage  shite  all  currently  doing  nothing  for  me.
__label__m _U  i'm  glad  you  got  your  methadone  mate,  i  was  getting  worried  there  😂
__label__m But  there  was  no  morphine.  Only  two  hospitals  in  the  entire  district  had  it.
__label__a so  apparantly  oxycodone  make  me  like  and  retweet  everything  i  see.
__label__m I  really,  really,  really  hate  wearing  jeans.  It  has  now  become  a  tactile  sensory  overload  thing,  and  is  tooooootally  making  me  anxious  right  now.  I.  Can't.  Move.  In.  Them.  This  is  why  I  wear  leggings  all  the  time.  I  need  a  Valium.
__label__m _U  _U  Are  they  the  ones  that  make  that  nice  morphine  syrup?
__label__c Should  I  take  a  Xanax  before  going  to  get  a  new  phone  and  new  phone  plan  in  store?
__label__m today  i  had  a  lady  super  high  on  meth  call  me  a  bitch  bc  i  wouldn't  give  her  methadone
__label__m _U  _U  use  the  weaker  opioid  tramadol  .  follow  the  directions  ...that's  what  they  are  there  for.      opioid    problems  come  from  misuse
__label__c _U  i'm  popping  a  xanax  right  now!!
__label__m there's  gabapentin,  diclofenac,  cyclobenzaprine,    and  another  one  i  forgot
__label__m _U  👆actually,  its  lyrica
__label__m _U  feat    diazepam    🖕
__label__c My  surgery  happened  this  morning  and  I  was  under  a  LOT  of  morphine  &  pain  meds  but  I  distinctly  remember  that  my  dad  and  I  ate  popsicles  together  and  recited  about  half  of  What  We  Do  In  the  Shadows  while  I  was  in  recovery
__label__c everyone  be  like  i  love  adderall  and  vyvanse  and  i  be  like  yeah  that  stuff  made  me  want  to  kill  myself  since  october
__label__m she  asked  the  captain  if  the  whole  thing  was  a  morphine  fever  dream.  the  captain  said  he  couldn't  tell,  bc  he  would  be  part  of  the  dream  too
__label__m _U  bladder  problems?  talk  with  your  doctor  about  xanax  today!
__label__m _U  _U  El  Rushbo  may  just  got  back  to  Dr.  shopping  for  Oxycontin...
__label__m I  never  got  the  Morphine  at  my  door🙃
__label__c _U  he  gave  me  23  klonopin  to  get  home
__label__m "i  asked  my  parents  for  a  vyvanse  prescription  for  christmas"  #college
__label__c _U  It  took  me  1.5  years  of  withdrawal  from  klonopin  to  finally  be  off  it.  It  sucked,  hard.  I  wish  you  luck  ❤️
__label__m _U  watching  the  #isles  rangers  game  from  October  '17  (_U  )  first  goal  on  msgplus  right  now  and  it's  not  helping.  This  is  torture,  I  need  a  bucket  of  Xanax  then  use  said  bucket  for  my  tears  in  2  hours  and  5  minutes...  How  are  you  coping?  #tavarmageddon
__label__m _U  I  don't  usually  need  ativan...
__label__m _U  Must  be  on  Valium
__label__m _U  Xanax  scrip,  is  that  like  XanaxCoin
__label__c _U        Cat,    Hey  I  just  read  your  article  on  Adderall.  Ugh  I  start  the  big  tomorrow  without  it.  Cold  Turkey.
__label__m _U  WPRR  Dave  Johnson  Cut  to  the  Chase.  Give  them  CBD  for    Detoxing.  Suboxone,  methadone  Fed.  Controlled  Substance  shouldn't  take  another  synthetic  drug.  Why  do  Physicians  keep  poisoning  you?  CBD  takes  crappy  feelings  drug  side  effects,  coming  down.  Take  6-7  da,  6  Wks.
__label__m _U  I  still  probably  put  a  handful  of  patients  with  it  on  methadone  this  year  (who  were  maximized  on  gabapentin).  Wish  you  could  have  used  them  for  a  series.
__label__m _U  _U  tramadol  is  an  opioid,  check  bnf  website  if  you  need  confirmation.  👍🏻
__label__m _U  _U  All  this  really  raises  is  that  it  might  not  be  the  most  effective  treatment  100%  of  the  time  and  should  be  prescribed  with  caution.  Drugs  like  diazepam  are  succesful  sometimes  without  severe  consequences.  Other  times,  other  treatments  would  be  more  appropriate.
__label__c _U  Tramadol  but  my  pain  tolerance  low  cause  I’m  a  lil  bitch😫
__label__a _U  11  hour  to  hawaii  i  did  8  valium  and  8  vodkas,  wish  i  could  tell  you  what  happens  in  train  wreck  but  i  can't
__label__c _U  I  sit  here  thinking  🤔  bipolar  sucks  a@@  &  seroquel  is  the  devil  but  a  coma...  for  reals!!!  🙌🏻  can  I  get  the  dets  so  I  don’t  die.  Hope  I’m  skinny  and  karma  has  finally  doing  its  job  when  I  awake.  🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
__label__c woke  up  at  5  and  took  hydrocodone  so  that  about  sums  up  my  week
__label__c Anyone  on  Gabapentin/Neurontin  experience  working  memory  deficit  or  inability  to  recall  memories  or  your  life/everyday  activities  unless  someone  triggers  the  memory?    I  dunno  if  this  is  #gabapentin  #neurontin  #memoryloss  #trauma
__label__m _U  cold  laser  therapy  for  my  15/2  year  old  dog  is  arthritis  has  been  a  godsend.  She's  walking  a  hundred  percent  better.  I  also  have  her  on  gabapentin  and  Tramadol  and  rimadyl  and  that  along  with  the  cold  laser  therapy  twice  a  week  has  made  100%,  just  FYI
__label__m niggas  compete  for  xanax  like  a  fucking  track  race  &  they  can't  even  run  😂
__label__a I  need  Vyvanse  still,  so,  get  to  work  Twitter!
__label__m Have  recurrent  procrastination?Yes?You  suffer  from  DID.This  causes  complete  blindness.Try  Methadone
__label__m i  dont  understand  people  who  eat  xanax  on  a  regular  basis  to  get  fucked  up.  how  are  you  having  fun  not  remembering  that  day  n  not  doin  shit?
__label__m _U  Most  likely  she  was  looking  for  Dilaudid  and  Phenergen  and  percocet,  he  refused  to  write  a  script  because  she's  just  there  2  get  high.
__label__a i  got  the  loud  i  need  some  xanz  n  percs  i  got  adderall  too
__label__m The  term  Medical  Marijuana  ?  It  just  seems  incorrect  ,  and  a  continuously  prejudice  way  of  continuing  a  negative  stigma  against  marijuana  .  Like  calling  Morphine  ,  Medical  opium  .  🤔  LR  07/2018
__label__m _U  Believe  it  or  not  but  a  methadone  user  wrote  an  article  today  saying  it  discriminates  against  drug  users  driving,  and  actually  said  it’s  the  fault  of  the  government  for  not  having  more  methadone  pickup  places  which  forces  users  to  drive  further  for  treatment.  True  story
__label__a i've  taken  so  much  klonopin  today  and  also  and  very  sad
__label__m _U  Like  holding  back  you're  on  methadone??  Lol.  Lessons  never  stop

__label__c anxiety  for  and  lunch  klonopin  for  dessert  😊  yum
__label__m The  jet  flew  overhead  at  1234.8  kph.    The  sound  of  the  speed  explosion  was  huge.  We  were  all  taking  valium  nervously,  #ThenBoomDroppedTheMic
__label__a bumping  future  +  adderall  +  home  alone  =  one  clean  ass  fucking  house.
__label__c i  really  hate  when  people  use  xanax  to  get  high  off  of  it,  like  nigga  nooo,  do  you  know  how  much  i  have  to  pay  for  my  meds??
__label__m _U  have  you  been  on  quetiapine/seroquel  before?  it's  an  antipsychotic  that  is  very  effective  against  anxiety
__label__m _U  So  my  understanding  is  that  hydrocodone  already  has  acetaminophen  in  it.  The  bottle  should  specify.  They  do  it  on  purpose  to  keep  people  from  ODing.  I  can't  remember  the  specific  details
__label__a i'm  starting  to  think  my  body  gets  nutrients  from  adderall  and  thc
__label__m thinking  of  taking  a  train  across  the  country  to  denver  and  then  seattle  in  dead  winter  with  an  ipod  a  notebook  and  a  bunch  of  valium

__label__c when  i  was  all  doped  up  my  nurse  asked  if  i  wanted  more  morphine  &  i  responded  with  "hell  yeah  brother"
__label__m _U  i'll  give  a  guess  that  adderall  is  more  accurately  dosed.
__label__m so  what  deciple  sold  jesus  out  for  like  20  xanax  bars??
__label__c adderall  got  me  having  a  full  on  texting  conversation  with  my  asian  mom

__label__m _U  _U  _U  He  didnt  die  of  an  overdose.  This  girl  purposely  sold  him  a  laced  xanax.  He  had  an  amazing  soul  and  it's  heartbreaking  to  know  that  he  died  way  too  soon.
__label__m ya  know  how  cocaine  was  medicine  wayyy  back.  i  feel  like  xanax  bars  are  gonna  be  seen  like  that  in  50-100  years.
__label__c _U  saw  gen  dr  in  ny  who  thankfullly  gave  me  xanax  to  sleep.  no  coverage  for  "specialist"  but  can  get  appt  for  gen  dr  in  2-3  months
__label__m you  know  what  you  should  really  do?  you  should  probably  crush  up  adderall  and  snort  it  in  front  of  your  bartender.
__label__c adderall  had  me  cleaning  my  car  with  a  toothbrush  true  story

__label__c took  a  vyvanse  and  now  i  live
__label__m _U  I  think  practicing  medicine  implies  some  sort  of  necessity.  Like  morphine  is  medicine  to  one  person,  and  just  used  an  addictive  vice  by  others.

__label__c After  taking  tramadol  for  the  first  time,  it  solved  all  the  pain  issues  and  some  enough,  I  was  recovering  fast  without  pain.  Then  the  ultimate  maddest  thing  happened..  The  tramadol  was  giving  me  constipation  and  before  I  knew  it,  I  had  PILE...  Another  wahala  be  that..
__label__c vyvanse  made  me  figure  out  all  my  spending  money  which  is  basically  none🙃
__label__m _U  Leave  a  little  bag  of  catnip  on  the  floor  on  the  other  side  of  your  room.  Even  ghost  cats  cannot  resist  it  and  will  leave  you  alone.  Cat  Valium  works  too.  For  you  and  ghost  cat.

__label__a just  took  3  oxycodone  for  pain,  probably  gonna  die
__label__m _U  No  max  dose  because  patients  become  tolerant  of  the  dose  they're  on  &  may  need  to  be  increased.  Or  may  be  Methadone  maintained  patients  who  need  higher  dose  when  treated  for  pain.

Highly  addictive?  Causes  depression?
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Personally  I'd  vote  for  Seroquel,  but  if  you  think  it  would  help,  we'll  start  mixing  it  into  the  sweet  tea  at  Cracker  Ass  Cracker  Barrel.

__label__m _U  _U  That’s  only  because  1%  of  twitter  doesn’t  need  valium.      We  all  need  a  good  shag.
__label__a i  have  a  shit  ton  of  paintings  to  get  done  in  a  short  period  of  time  whoever  donates  me  adderall  ill,  idk  but  i  really  could  use  it  ya  know

__label__c And  I  haven't  had  adderall  in  like  5  months  so  u  do  the  nose  maths
__label__c im  not  a  psych  but  i  either  need  a  new  antidepressant  thats  not  an  ssri  or  a  new  antipsychotic  possibly  typical  plus  my  regular  olanzapine  or/plus  a  mood  stabilizer  maybe  the  one  i  had  before  carbamezepine

So,  should  they  start  off  with  the  fetinyallknowwhat,  mixed  with  some  xanax?  Should  they  start  off  with  coke  and  xanax?
__label__a i  don't  have  any  responsibilities  tomorrow...well  today  so  i'm  going  to  take  adderall  and  write  for  hours  on  end
__label__a heck  naw,  you  savage  tho  rt  _U  have  you  snorted  xanax  ?  it's  some  trippy  shit.
__label__m Alabama  is  the  one  having  the  issues  not  OxyContin.    When  you  have  as  many  youth  &  adults  using  this  drug  &  can  not  stop  using  this  drug  this  means  they  need  2  look  into  addictions  not  the  opioids.  Once  they  can  no  longer  get  hold  of  opioids  they  will  find  something  else  to  use.
__label__c hmmmm  to  take  this  adderall  or  to  not
__label__c _U  I  slept  all  the  way  through  it...damn  Valium..S

__label__m These  oxycodone
__label__m _U  Just  give  him  a  morphine  overdose.  All  this  business  of  using  exotic  chemicals  is  silly.
__label__m _U  right  like  for  some  reason  being  dead  on  xanax  is  socially  acceptable  while  smokin  ain't  ???
__label__a adderall  is  great  except  when  i  become  hyperfocused  on  something  other  than  homework  and  i  spend  40  minutes  telling  my  roommate  about  the  myth  of  meritocracy  and  the    history  of  de  facto  segregation  in  america
__label__m Suboxone  should  be  illegal.  It  kills  people  just  as  easy  as  heroin  can.
__label__m people  that  wear  "Fuck  Xanax"  hoodies  are  so  cringey
__label__c The  anxiety  and  depression  always  hits  me  when  I'm  away  from  home  and  super  stressed.  Xanax  helps  but...boy  do  I  do  some  stupid  shit.

__label__c _U  Take  care  of  yourself!!  Def  better  to  be  safe!  ❤❤❤  For  me  besides  the  pain  (that  oxycodone  couldn't  touch)  the  shortness  of  breath  was  what  told  me  something  was  up,  I  couldn't  even  walk  up  the  single  flight  of  stairs  in  our  apt  without  having  to  lie  down  😱
__label__m "with  less  pain,  i  feel  better,"  an  actor  just  said  in  a  lyrica  commercial.

__label__m percocet  and  codeine  please  dont  taake  my  lifee
__label__m _U  How  could  it  be  an  'innocent  mistake'?    You  can't  walk  into  Boots  the  Chemist  in  the  UK  and  buy  any  #Tramadol  at  all,  let  alone  300.    They  are  only  available  by  prescription  and  my  uneducated  guess  is  you  wouldn't  be  getting  prescribed  300,  however  bad  your  back  was.
__label__m _U  _U  the  dr  who  carries  a  syringe  of  diazepam  on  his  belt?    lol.  it's  obvious  she's  hiding  stuff  and  she's  lying!
__label__m Oboy  calmed  her  down.  Said  he  was  tired  but  promised  to  make  it  up  to  her.  Called  a  friend  who  recommended  Tramol  (Tramadol)  to  face  her
__label__m Yes,  among  other  things!  Legitimate  patients  R  being  swept  up  alongside  the  abusers  while  the  gov  is  cracking  (  no  pun  intended!)  down  on  the  dr's  &  dr's  are  now  taking  it  away  from  people  who  really  need  it!    Theyre  trying    2get  you  put  on  'Suboxone'  which  does  nada  4your  pain!
__label__m _U  On  god  the  only  way  to  go  if  u  on  xanax  is  down
__label__c They  gave  me  this  Seroquel  pill  that  supposed  to  put  me  dead  sleep.  If  I  don't  get  back  to  you,  this  means  I'm  insomnia  free  y'all

__label__a im  lyin  im  not  sure  if  i  was  like  this  is  when  i  was  doing  lots  of  xanax  so  im  just  assuming  and  im  probably  right
__label__c I  hate  when  people  ask  to  buy  my  Adderall,  especially  when  they  know  how  much  I  actually  need  them.      It's  like  asking  a  paraplegic,  "Hey  bud,  can  I  borrow  your  wheelchair  for  the  day?  I  know  you  need  it  and  all,  but  it's  just  so  much  more  fun  getting  drunk  on  wheelchairs."

__label__c why  have  companies  started  phoning  at  8am  to  talk  to  me?  woke  me  up  but  i'd  taken  diazepam  in  the  night  for  pain  so  she  got  no  sense  from  me
__label__a dawg  where  can  i  buy  xanax  in  the  philippines
__label__m Dammit.  Y’all  gonna  have  to  give  ME  a  Xanax  if  we  keep  seeing  his  flashbacks.  They’re  so  heartbreaking.    #TheCrossing
__label__m totally  agree  with  giving  free  and  clean  needles  and  methadone  to  drug  users.  but  we  should  give  free  meds  to  cancer  patient  too?  #copafeel
__label__c “I  felt  like  shit  earlier  but  I  took  a  klonopin  and  a  drag  of  my  juul  and  I  was  fine”
__label__m i  will  lose  weight  with  out  adderall  because  i'm  jumping  around  like  a  maniac
__label__a I  hope  a  freak  accident  happens  and  I  fucking  die  bc  he’s  better  off  without  me.  I  hope  I  have  a  heart  attack  from  all  the  adderall
__label__u “_U:  that  lyrica  anderson  -  feenin  go  so  hard”-❤️❤️
__label__m the  xanax  and  lean  got  them  so  braindead  to  see  that  that  didn't  end  well  for  lil  wayne  and  it  won't  end  well  for  them  either
__label__m why  have  adderall  when  you  can  have  pre-work  jungle  juice?  #same
__label__m he  literally  almost  asked  the  store  worker  if  they  had  any  christmas  ativan  calendars  hahahaha
__label__c _U  They  gave  my  Diazepam.  Quite  a  lot  of  it  too.  I  might  not  even  remember  it  😂
__label__c _U  that,  and  the  klonopin  is  finally  kicking  in.
__label__m _U  He  was  abusing  drugs  (  I  heard  Valium)  but  you  never  hear  about  it  or  an  autopsy  because  the  pharmaceutical  companies  want  it  covered  up.
__label__c tramadol  works  wonders.
__label__m i  switched  on  real  housewives  and  the  first  words  were:  “it’s  true  i  did  have  a  xanax  problem!!”.  exactly  what  i  wanted  out  of  _U  !!
__label__m _U  _U  How  much  oxycontin  must  you  do  daily  to  think  ole  Mitch  sd  be  a  Senator?
__label__c _U  Following  this  very  closely.  Just  started  Tramadol  a  few  weeks  ago  due  to  severe  arthritis.  I  take  one  every  morning  and  it  gets  me  through  the  day.  Haven't  noticed  any  side  effects.  Being  very  cautious  now,  though!
__label__u _U  _U  _U  hey  i  made  my  question  rhyme  with  the  lyrica
__label__m _U  get  the  xanax  and  the  addy  ready
__label__m _U  hey  bro  loved  the  track  Oxycontin,  what's  that  sample  at  the  beginning?
__label__a i  honestly  dont  know  how  im  awake  since  i  took  6  hydrocodone  pills  hahaha
__label__m Designer  shoes  and  xanax  tabs,  compliment  your  make  up  bag,  you  never  had  to  buy  yourself  a  drink,  cause  everybody  wonna  tap  that  ass.
__label__m This  doc  on  adderall  is  pretty  cool
__label__c i  had  to  take  xanax  before  going  into  work  bc  i  was  afraid  id  have  an  anxiety  attack  but  i  quit  and  life  is  good  and  im  happy  for  once
__label__m I  did  CPR  on  one  for  nearly  12  mins  &  we  still  don't  know  if  it'll  have  neuro  deficits  or  not.  Maxed  both  out  on  valium;  tremors  cont'd.
__label__m I'm  not  actually  giving  babies  xanax  ok  so  let's  calm  down
__label__c _U  i'm  feeling  pretty  good!  i  started  a  new  therapy  a  few  weeks  ago  &  lyrica  for  my  nerve  pain.
__label__m _U  It  must  have  been  the  Valium  shot  she  gives  herself.  Anyone  seen  her  laying  on  the  ground  lately?
__label__m _U  And  can  get  really  depressed  and  ill  if  left  in  a  cage  outside.  Bunny  proof  all  your  wires  and  cables  though,  and  hide  the  chocolate,  it's  like  bloody  methadone  to  bunnies  !!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Xanax  is  just  as  bad  as  anything  else.  Thats  why  i  tell  my  girl  not  to  take  them  everyday
__label__a #riomesain5words  🔴⚫  let's  get  stupid  on  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  _U  #Gabapentin  poison  for  one.
__label__m _U  One  of  the  newest,  most  state-of-the-art  buildings  in  Daytona  area:  Daytona  Methadone  Treatment  Center
__label__m doctors  newly  licensed  can  only  treat  30  patients  with  suboxone  in  first  year,  100  in  next  year.  obama  just  proposed  new  rules  to  make  200.
__label__u i  was  sleep  on  lyrica  for  a  minite  ..  she  go  hard  tho  .  
__label__m _U  I  heard  today  that  methadone,  above  a  certain  level,  is  included  in  the  nine  banned  prescription  drugs  in  this  new  law.  True?
__label__c i'm  not  going  to  sleep  anytime  soon,  thank  you  adderall
__label__c _U  True  true  true.  It's  not  prescribed  in  Aus  anymore  to  new  patients.  Valium  lorazepam  temazepam  etc.  Ive  still  got  some  bars  from  2011  when  i  was  first  prescribed.  Theyre  never  gonna  get  consumed
__label__c hope  this  xanax  makes  me  sleep
__label__m i  knew  ohio  was  smashed  by  xanax  but  damn  are  you  kids  some  idiots,  taking  20  bars  a  week  like  you  aint  got  a  problem  😂
__label__c the  only  things  keeping  me  alive  are  hydrocodone  syrup,  starbucks  "coffee  &  protein",  technical  death  metal,  and  the  100  books  i  brought.
__label__m some  people  will  be  taking  codeine  mixed  with  tramadol  and  i'll  be  wondering  if  they  have  death  wish,  like  what  is  all  these  nonsense
__label__c xanax  had  me  on  twitter  tonight
__label__m How  much  xanax  and  lean  do  you    need  to  do  to  realize  your  a  fucking  loser  😆
__label__m _U  Methadone  ~  Its  whats  for  breakfast  in  Eagle  country
__label__m _U  _U  _U  thanks  for  confirming  that  you're  a  worthless  piece  of  shit.  enjoy  your  oxycontin  overdose.
__label__a I  need  ritalin.  Adderall.  Something.
__label__c #ikeepcalmby  way  of  a  daily  regimen  of  xanax  smoothies.
__label__c On  8  mg  of  klonopin  😁
__label__a _U  who  got  the  xanax  ?
__label__m Afternoon!  Husband  is  going  for  a  morphine  related  nap  &  im  headed  to  the  shop  for  chocolate  &  lightbulbs
__label__m googles:  how  to  not  cry  and  violently  beg  for  xanax  when  i  see  my  psychiatrist
__label__m _U  _U  Already  told  u  get  on  the  tramadol  and  codeine  you’ll  be  sorted
__label__a i  have  taken  so  much  valium  and  i'm  still  not  asleep  why  is  this  happening  to  me
__label__c Should  be  studying,  but  the  only  thing  I’ve  reviewed  tonight  is  Ativan.  Maybe  that’ll  be  on  my  test  tomorrow  #CodeBlack
__label__a xanax  and  beer  horrible  mix  .  crying  for  days  .  sorry  guys  :(
__label__c _U  If  it  weren’t  for  #MedicalCannabis  #medicalmarijuana  I’d  still  be  on  Morphine!  I  had  been  addicted  to  morphine  for  6  1/2  years  due  to  #chronicpain!  I’ve  been  clean  for  35  days  now!  #OpiodCrisis
__label__c _U  I  had  to  go  of  Seroquel  b/c  the  increased  risk  of  stroke  in  the  elderly.  Neurologist  and  Pysch  don’t  want  to  take  a  risk  since  I’ve  had  3  already.
__label__m I  don't  think  you  have  to  be  a  Rod  Serling  to  write  a  gripping  script  where  her  character  dies  after  choking  on  a  ham  sandwich  a  la  Mama  Cass  while  on  lunchbreak  in  the  coalmine  shaft,  after  having  mixed  accidentally  10  oxycodone  pills  with  her  breaktime  coffee  one  hour  before...
__label__u Can  Lyrica  please  let  this  orange  hair  go.  She  needs  to  let  that  roadkill  dieeeeeeee  #LHHH
__label__c _U  _U  gws  chief!  looks  like  the  morphine  is  working!  🙈
__label__m _U  Did  you  notice  a  majority  of  them  talk  like  they  are  on  Valium??  Especially  Hank  Johnson  🙄
__label__c it's  hard  to  find  a  positive  outlook  on  life  in  a  hospital..  that  is  until  the  morphine  kicks  in  and  my  mom  becomes  a  comedian
__label__m _U  _U  Who  paid  off  Representatives  Marino  (PA)  &  Blackburn  (TN)  to  pass  a  bill  that  prevented  the  DEA  from  effectively  enforcing  drug  laws  for  Opioids  (OxyContin  &  pain  pills)?
__label__m update:  my  friend’s  dad  is  high  on  morphine,  walked  into  the  kitchen,  farted,  and  left
__label__m _U  Jesus,  you're  tweeting  again.  Go  swallow  some  valium.
__label__a when  you're  on  an  adderall  binge  it's  so  hard  to  stop,  cause  the  only  thing  that  makes  you  feel  better  is  more  adderall
__label__a Refilled  the  Morphine  bottle.
__label__m Watching  Trisha  on  Morphine  is  so  good
__label__c i  thank  the  universe  that  valium  is  prescribed  to  me.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  i  share  your  pain..  but  being  on  tramadol  was  fun...  kinda
__label__m harry  talking  about  morphine  pklease  fucsk  it  up
__label__c Idk  why  but  every  time  I  take  adderall  I  get  a  hard  on  that  won’t  leave
__label__m my  co  worker  told  me  he  just  found  a  bag  of  xanax  in  the  trash  wow.  lol  what  the  hell
__label__c _U  I’m  good  at  letting  that  go.  .  .  But  the  mild  amnesiatic  properties  of  Neurontin  has  everything  to  do  with  that  cuz  boy  if  i  can  remember  i  obsess  bigtime.
__label__m _U  _U  10mg  adderal  is  equivalent  to  30mg  vyvanse  lol..  if  you  take  30mg  than  you  need  70mg  vyvanse
__label__c also  disappointed  to  announce  my  pain  is  no  longer  bad  enough  for  me  to  get  morphine  👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
__label__c 2mg  of  clonazepam  is  not  enough  wht  th  eufck
__label__m Anything  you  read  on  Twitter  doesn't  need  a    pinch  of  salt....      It  needs  a  pinch  of  Valium.
__label__a _U  I’ll  be  on  10  pounds  of  adderall
__label__a i'm  getting  scared  that  the  cool  kids  won't  wanna  be  my  friends  in  edinburgh  because  i've  had  too  much  whiskey  and  valium  😂😂
__label__m wow  i  need  a  valium
__label__a gonna  start  injecting  xanax  into  my  eye  balls  with  a  10  inch  syringe  to  go  to  sleep  on  time
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  And  maybe  a  nice  little  Xanax  to  go  with  that  tea.
__label__m _U  i  agree.  especially  in  the  case  of  adderall  it  makes  me  feel  weird  since  it's  heavily  marketed  to  kids...
__label__m _U  It's  not  just  IV  fluids.  Drugs  like  Dilaudid,  Morphine,  Fentanyl  are  becoming  or  have  become  almost  impossible  to  get.  Priority  goes  to  bigger  hospitals  but  small  long-term  places  use  them  too.  You  can  switch  most  to  PO  but  that's  not  always  an  option.
__label__c _U  Noooo,  this  can't  be  from  that  disaster  WSJ  interview  right?  Please  say  this  one's  satire.  Not  that  I  think  it  is,  I've  just  run  out  of  Xanax  tis  all.
__label__c I  took  this  oxycodone  for  my  cramps  and  I’m  bout  ready  to  call  it  a  night  😭😭😭
__label__m _U  _U  _U  You  do  not  need  religion  to  have  values  for  one  thing.  For  another,  if  you’re  praising  Xanax  which  I  have  seen  the  ill  affectsto  the  mind  in  others  first  hand,  you  are  hardly  in  the  right  state  of  mind  to  criticize  others  for  promoting  voter  registration  😉
__label__c _U  _U  _U  Maybe  they’re  using  different-size  needles  or  something  but  when  I  had  my  marrow  extracted  (I  was  a  donor  to  a  leukemia  pt)  I  got  IV  morphine  &  spinal  anesthesia..&  I  was  sore  as  hell  for  days.  And  I  was  only  20yo.  Don’t  get  how  these  elderly  pts  tolerate  it.
__label__m 2/2  It’s  like  giving  a  person  with  addictive  tendencies  a  refillable  morphine  prescription.  I’ve  seen  it  first  hand  in  a  family  member  a  two  family  friends  kids.  Parenting  is  a  HUGE  part  in  all  of  this.
__label__m _U  I’m  old  enough  to  have  seen  the  arrival  of  the  opiates.    I  knew  zero  people  in  the  80’s  addicted  to  them,  and  by  the  year  2000  it  was  ravaging  people.    Particalarly  the  working  class  whites  I  knew.      The  methadone  industry  needs  an  expose’  also.
__label__c one  thought  that  i  have  everyday  without  fail  is  “i  miss  valium”
__label__c do  not  try  oxycodone  you  will  regret  it  i  promise  you
__label__m i  need  a  xanax  and  nap  before  i  can  continue  working.
__label__m _U  Being  trolled.  Having  a  "trace"  of  morphine  is  quite  different  than  being  high  on  morphine.
__label__m _U  I  saw  some  of  this  last  night.  Man,  it  was  as  if  Adderall  came  to  life  and  wrote  a  screenplay.  Also,  what  a  waste  of  _U  's  talents.
__label__m _U  what's  up  man!  love  medicated  mondays  but  hate  benzs.  they  ruin  more  lives  than  opiates.    adderall  is  the  winner  though
__label__a need  adderall  rn  so  i  can  get  shit  done.  sos
__label__m _U  _U  However  much,  marijuana's  still  safer  than  just  one  pack  of  cigarettes,  a  bottle  of  fentanyl,  oxyconton,  alcohol  you  name  it
__label__u Dang,  lyrica  wrote  on  party?!?!  That's  wassup  #LHHH
__label__m _U  take  a  Xanax  and  go  back  to  bed.  #StableGenius  #ImpeachTrump  #NotMyPresident  #DumpTrump
__label__a you  know  yours  buzzed  on  adderall  when  you  look  up  its  chemical  salt-features  and  bioplasm  structures  on  wikipedia,  for  a  few  half  hours.
__label__a WHY  IS  THIS  TOWN  SO  FUCKING  SHIT  FOR  XANAX  FUCK  I  NEED  THAT  SHIT
__label__a uhhhhhhh  who  has  adderall
__label__c strained  shoulder/neck  thurs.  regular  1800mg  neurontin  15mg  meloxicam  &  12mg  zanaflex  daily  +tens  unit  +  heat  &  ice  still  not  helping.  :/
__label__m Flulalin  (antiviral  drug)  Used  with  Lamictal  to  treat  Albrecht  Durer's  disease  Contraindicated  by  Adderall
__label__c also  lmk  why  i  was  prescribed  hydrocodone  when  i  am  allergic  !!!!!!
__label__c adderall  count  as  a  drug?  if  so  then  no.  rt  _U:  would  you  be  able  to  function  at  work  without  drugs??
__label__c Nevermind  morphine  tablet  on  the  way...  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
__label__m _U  thanks.  need  to  do  my  breathing  exercises.  haven't  been  able  to  get  to  doc  for  diazepam  either  😂  probably  good  if  i  want  to  drink.
__label__m _U  Here's  some  morphine  💉
__label__m Anyone  else  not  thinking  that  Pusha  and  Kanye  sampled  that  Santeria  beat  off  Daytona  from  Berners  Xanax  &  patron  off  of  prohibition  1.
__label__m Can't  even  sleep  at  night  without  Nyquill  become  a  valium  addict
__label__m _U  _U  vyvanse  has  adderall  in  it.
__label__a It's  almost  May...bring  out  the  adderall!

__label__u _U  off  to  _U  i  go.  let's  see  if  morphine  is  in  their  library.  stay  tuned...
__label__m i'm  dressing  up  as  a  giant  xanax  and  being  _U  for  halloween..  heard  it  lets  me  drink  free  all  night
__label__m _U  U  say  truly  but  .....  I  think  in  different  way  Bengal  needs  morphine  or  it  will  be  late  to  survive  with  pain  in  all  respect
__label__m maxine  trying  to  sleep  without  xanax  is  one  more  reason  i  feel  like  jerrod  is  writing  her  character  to  help  people  like  me  see  themselves  😅
__label__m for  every  xan  you  pop  you  can  become  sober  by  taking  adderall...  if  you're  over  dosing  on  xanax  this  fact  can  save  your  life.
__label__m _U  yes,  i  don't  think  i'm  unusual  in  finding  it  difficult  to  equate  the  routine  use  of  tramadol  with  'eating  pasta'.
__label__m the  big  lebowski  is  like  a  xanax
__label__m State's  supply  of  Diazepam  has  apparently  expired.    Attorney  claims  it  is  "possible"  another  supplier  could  be  found  or  a  substitute  could  be  found.  Not  very  many  specifics  provided  on  either  point...
__label__c (meds  dosage)  is  it  ok  to  take  tramadol  with  5mcg    butrans  patch?  i'm  in  so  much  pain  right  now
__label__m _U  _U  lol  just  go  to  the  doctor,  say  you  have  trouble  leaving  the  house  without  an  episode,  boom  xanax  scrip
__label__m Nutt  did  a  study  on  how  benzodiazepines  (  Valium/Ativan)  work  in  brain  &  what  receptors  they  work  on  to  calm  an  anxious  person  down.
__label__a i  heard  niggas  doin  $10  for  a  fuckin  xanax  bar.....you  got  me  all  the  way  fucked  up.

MD:  they  switched  the  placebos  &  the  real  thing  Woman:  dials  phone.  Hello?  I  need  to  file  a  lawsuit...oh,  Doctor?  I  need  an  Ativan  script  ASAP
__label__c How  I’m  up  right  now  is  beyond  me  lol  3  hours  of  sleep..  i  either  need  melatonin  or  adderall.
__label__c _U  _U  can  you  guys  keep  it  down?  i  just  took  my  adderall  and  it  hasn't  taken  hold  yet.
__label__a It’s  legal  to  snort  my  own  hydrocodone  why  not?

__label__a _U  Haven't  done  Xanax  since  like  2014  lmao  yet  alone  tweeted  about  it  lmao  how  old  are  you
__label__m They  go  through  the  court  system.  Probation,  jail,  parole.  Feeding  the  system.      Rehab,  soboxone  clinics,  methadone.  Feeding  the  system.      And  illegal  immigration  brings  in  a  treasure  trove  of  damaged  and  need  kids  to  be  exploited.  Feeding  the  system.
__label__c _U  I'm  on  morphine  (30mlg)  for  the  damages  to  my  spine  when  I  fell  off  a  cliff.  I  take  my  medicine  as  prescribed  and  never  thought    I'd    be  grouped  in  with  drug  addicts  !

__label__m _U  _U  _U  Someone  needs  to  throw  a  couple  Valium  into  her  throat  every  day.
__label__c _U  _U  I’m  on  pain  meds  too  but  they  dont  work  on  the  sciatica  as  it’s  a  nerve,  the  Gabapentin  works  I  believe  by  blocking  the  pain  response.  What  ever  it  does  and  grateful  for  it.💖

__label__a fellas  don't  mess  around  with  Xanax.  I  had  a  friend  who  couldn't  get  it  up  after  he  took  too  much,  no  joke
__label__m _U  _U  pill  mill  docs  got  them  hooked  on  oxycontin  -  then  the  oxy  was  taken  away  so  they  went  to  heroin.
__label__m I  guess  because  they  put  her  on  morphine  ,  they  gonn  take  they  time  now.

__label__m dilaudid  &  oxycodone  are  the  only  drugs  that  help  with  your  pain?  controlled  substances  only,  okay!
__label__a _U  the  goal  is  to  have  a  nice  baseline  buzz  in  four  hours  so  i'm  starting  with  alcohol  and  valium  -  what  about  your  candy  ass?
__label__m _U  _U  I  did  say  you'd  need  some  xanax  TLG  lol.  Reckon  we're  in  the  last  phase  of  the  shenanigans.  After  all,  Feb  is  crunch  time

__label__m I  wonder  if  risperdal  interferes  with  our  dreams.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  i'm  not  sure  he's  enjoying  anything  but  morphine  right  now.
__label__c Tramadol  is.....suprisingly  really  nice

__label__c _U  not  for  e,  never  been  offered.  i've  had  it  for  pain  tho.  swollen  hands,  tiredness,  hunger.  i  take  pregabalin  instead,  v  similar.
__label__m Now  i’m  seeing  red,  not  thinking  straight,  blurring  all  the  lines,  you  intoxicate  me,  just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine,  suddenly
__label__u _U  now  is  not  a  time  for  grimes  lyrica
__label__u Lyrica,  alexis  sky  &  hazel  E  are  doing  too  much  this  season  of  love  and  hip  hop
__label__m the  man  sitting  behind  me  in  church  has  taken  high  doses  of  adderall  this  morning
__label__m really  wishing  adderall  was  free  right  about  now
__label__m _U  's  voice  on  Never  Be  the  Same  is  literally  just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine..  😍
__label__u yoooo  why  lyrica  momma  goin  so  hard  with  the  vocals  in  the  crowd  she  sound  good  doe  #lhhny
__label__m _U  _U  Nah  Diazepam  comes  from  the  lab  babe
__label__m Oh,  and  one  more  thing:  I  may  be  wrong,  but  I’m  still  pretty  sure  that  you’re  not  being  flagged  by  the  DEA  for  prescribing  0.5  mg  Klonopin  once  a  day  to  someone  who  is  also  on  50  mg  Tramadol  every  6  hours  as  needed,  especially  since  you  aren’t  the  one  prescribing  Tramadol.
__label__a coffee  and  adderall  had  a  real  "slimming  effect"  on  me
__label__c Just  woke  up  from  the  morphine  coma.  I'd  like  to  go  a  few  months  without  being  in  the  hospital  again  😔
__label__m _U  _U  but  its  effectiveness  is  probably  reduced  by  a  stimulant  like  adderall
__label__m listening  to  pachelbel  now,  i'm  remembering  how  well  i  used  to  sleep  en  corrélation  with  a  xanax  and  vodka  gimlet  every  night.
__label__m _U  I'm  curious  have  you  ever  done  tramadol
__label__c _U  think  will  take  another  week  to  get  quetiapine  back  in  my  system.even  if  not  slim  as  want  to  be  no  point  if  in  a  coffin  eh?
__label__m Coedine  is  banned  but  tramadol  isn't.  Crazy
__label__c //no  but  really  i  didn't  take  my  adderall  today  and  the  withdrawal  is  making  me  sleep  so  i  may  disappear  again.
__label__a i  rly  wanna  play  halo  on  adderall
__label__m _U  oh,  nothing  just  laughing  at  u  getting  Ambien  and  Xanax  at  the  same  time...
__label__m A  Valium  would  even  slightly  slow  my  heartbeat
__label__m not  surprising  that  a  rapper  overdosed  on  Xanax
__label__m _U  _U  It's  worse  than  that.  Ibogaine  can  cure  heroin  addiction  much  more  efficiently  than  methadone.  It's  legal  in  Europe  &  Asia.  But,  the  patent  on  it  expired.  The  drug  company  couldn't  make  money  off  it,  so  they  never  applied  for  FDA  approval.
__label__c Tramadol  makes  me  throw  up.  No  such  thing  as  a  good  pain  pill.  #endometriosis
__label__m look  at  that  ,  it's  a  xanax  ,  take  it  and  take  a  nap!
__label__a _U  i'll  bring  the  xanax  &  vino.
__label__m morphine  already,  based  in  decimals  -  instruments  used  for  injection  =  decimalized  -  intent  is  disguised  then  -  no  legal  process  -  id'd  ever
__label__m _U  we  need  to  put  _U  on  abilify    or  cymbalta  his  eternal  search  for  the  black  hole  in  every  news  story  is  disturbing
__label__m _U  Aunt  Emily  doesn't  like  it  when  people  start  asking  questions  about  her  beloved  Barack's  presidential  style  of  *leading  from  (his)  behind.*    Looks  like  it's  going  to  be  a  Xanax  Monday  for  Aunt  Emily!
__label__m Watched    #SisterWives  Maddy  birth  that  baby.  She  was  stalled  because  the  myriads  of  humans  watching  her  like  a  cow  in  labor  at  the  fair.  Hospital,  no  crew  and  a  damned  epidural  or  at  least  an  Ativan-  good  lord!
__label__a when  some  of  my  friends  say  they  got  xanax  in  they  sprite  it  gets  me  sad  asf  cause  little  do  they  know  they  finna  die  in  a  lil  minute
__label__m _U  Hey  Donnie  go  take  a  nap  it’s  been  a  long  week  for  you.  How  about  you  take  some  Valium  while  you’re  at  it.  Fucking  schmuck.
__label__c yoo  the  hospital  gave  me  morphine  to  take  home  meet  me  in  the  hallway  vibes
__label__m nothing  quite  like  a  room  filled  with  the  sickly-sweet  smell  of  teen  stress  hormones,  adderall  metabolites,  and  axe  body  spray.  #proctoring
__label__m I  need  to  take  a  Xanax  every  day  until  the  2018  Grammys  because  there  are  just  so  many  amazing  eligible  albums.
__label__a my  plan  for  today:    *pop  adderall*  pokemon  for  40  mins  get  car  keys  from  friends  dorm  buy  new  headphones  come  home  and  make  $  record  music
__label__m Have  bad  breath?You  probably  have  Alcohol  addiction.This  causes  skin  to  turn  orange.Try  Abilify
__label__m #wcw  to  _U  one  word.  genuine.  you're  a  doll  and  i  swear  your  voice  is  like  audio  valium  👏
__label__m _U  _U  _U  put  some  xanax  in  milk.    i  saw  it  on  a  tv  show  once
__label__m valium  hayley  is  the  best  hayley.  _U
__label__u _U  Can  I  commission  a  Prince  Valium  please
__label__m Please  stop  taking  Xanax.  You  will  die
__label__m Mix  the  Xanax  with  the  lean  I  call  it  thot  juice
__label__m _U  Isn't  everyone  at  CNN  BOMBED  all  the  time?  That  would  be  the  only  way  to  explain  their  erratic  behavior.  It's  Either  alcohol  or  their  zyprexa  hasn't  kicked  in...
__label__m _U  Wish  I  could  retweet  this  a  million  times  seen  too  many  close  ones  and  others  die  from  Xanax  and  prescription  drug  abuse
__label__m there's  2  types  of  dayz  gamers    those  who  carry  morphine  in  trousers,  and  those  who  don't  😂

__label__m i  had  a  dream  i  was  in  21  jumpstreet  and  jonah  hill  tried  to  feed  me  xanax
__label__c i  can't  wait  to  get  back  on  my  adderall  after  this  baby  comes.
__label__a _U  _U  _U  factorio  +  adderall  is  the  best  /  worst  decision  when  you've  got  a  couple  of  hits  to  spare.
__label__a _U  I  prefer  mine  with  Valium  and  a  shot  of  crater  lake  vodka!
__label__m just  so  you  know:  consistent  xanax  users  are  50%  more  likely  to  develop  alzheimer's
__label__c which  almost  always  violates  laws  and  the  doctors'  legal  contracts  with  insurance  providers.  To  put  it  bluntly  Suboxone  is  being  mis-used  across  America  and  I  am  one  of  its  victims. _U
__label__a _U  _U  _U  _U  How’s  bout  a  Xanax  lollipop?
__label__c Some  more  hydrocodone  and  muscle  relaxers.  Yay.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  Thank  you!  I  shall  be  talking  about  the  pregabalin  litigation  and  I  hope  to  make  it  exciting.
__label__a _U  _U  My  mate  _U  thinks  it’s  because  I  was  just  off  my  tits  on  morphine.
__label__m _U  damn!  how  horrible.  my  dr.  is  always  trying  to  give  me  pills  of  all  kinds.  my  father  takes  a  ton  of  lyrica  and  it  works  for  him.
__label__u Okay  I  feel  like  Lyrica  trippin.  Bitch  one  of  us  gotta  be  on  the  radio  cause  you  ain't.
__label__c After  over  5  hours  in  the  ER  earlier  today,  my  Valium  is  starting  to  wear  off  just  as  I’m  finally  getting  in  bed  and  I  feel  comfy  as  h*ck
__label__a who  wants  some  adderall  😂😭😩
__label__c i  can  bring  myself  back  down  from  a  ptsd  panic  attach  np,  but  a  palmetto  bug  in  the  kitchen?  i  require  xanax  to  come  back  from  that.

__label__m my  co-worker  puts  xanax  in  her  husband's  coffee  when  he  is  having  a  tough  week  at  the  office  lol
__label__a _U  Sippin  on  valium,  about  to  tear  a  labrum,  it’s  comeback  season,  I’m  about  to  go  0-1

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  you  claim  sending  you  virtual  seroquel
__label__a _U  I  have  eaten  three  fistsful  of  Xanax  in  order  to  curb  my  desire  to  stick  this  information  up  the  asses  of  my  Republican  loved  ones.
__label__m wes  welker  got  tested  for  that  adderall
__label__a waaaaaaaaasy  to  much  codeine  and  adderall
__label__m _U  It  was  fake  Xanax  for  all  i  know.  (That  was  actually  the  least  blatant  drug  dealing  I've  seen  around  here.)
__label__c when  a  hydrocodone  doesn't  work  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
__label__a And  right  now,  being  expressive  helps.  And  I'm  taking  extra  Clonazepam  to  nip  things  in  the  bud.
__label__m this  is  the  kind  of  weather  that  makes  you  wanna  pop  some  alprazolam  and  dissociate  in  a  hammock  😩😩😩👌🏻
__label__u the  lorazepam  has  such  a  good  moral  of  the  story  why  doesn't  the  world  learn  from  the  oncler's  mistakes
__label__a John  2017  -  “I  was  given  two  weeks  worth  of  Valium  from  the  doctors  and  I  was  off  my  nut  the  whole  time”
__label__u _U  not  saying  his  lyrica  were  bad  lol...got  tired  of  hearing  all  the  haaannnn's  by  french  montana
__label__m "_U:  adderall  had  me  thinking  about  accepting  your  farmville  invitation"  really  brings  me  back  _U
__label__a Is  xanax,  wine  and  hot  tub  a  good  combo??  Asking  for  a  friend.  She’s  had  a  ruff  week.
__label__m so  haloti  ngata  and  chris  davis  get  suspended  for  taking  adderall  but  jon  jones  was  allowed  to  fight  after  testing  positive  for  cocaine...
__label__m _U  So  what  is  literally  poison  for  you  can  still  work  miracles  for  me.  Just  like  oxycodone  makes  some  people  horribly  ill.
__label__m _U  _U  news:potato  trauma  is  increasing  the  supply  &  demand  of  valium  &  weed  world  wide  to  deal  with  amateur  bb  players  #bb18

__label__a i  decided  today  to  crush  my  (prescription)  adderall  and  stir  it  into  my  coffee.  i  think  i  might  be  able  to  control  time  for  a  few  hours.  😳😳😳
__label__c about  taking  scripted  xanax  an  other  related  or  simular  drugs,i  dont  like  being  around  people,i  have  extreme  social  anxiety,not  drug  seeking
__label__a anyone  got  any  adderall  i  mean  art  pills

__label__c The  best  thing  I  ever  did  for  myself  is  taking  myself  off  of  Adderall
__label__m _U  _U  #addictionchat  suboxone  has  naloxone  in  it  which  is  good  for  prevention  w/the  iv  user  but  may  cause  drowsiness

__label__u i'm  tryna  figure  out  why  pam  couldn't  have  stayed  somewhere  else  instead  of  with  her  son  and  lyrica  #lhhh
__label__m _U  pass  out  the  xanax  or  give  everyone  a  complimentary  shot  of  thorazine
__label__u _U  Morphine  Love  Makeup
__label__a There’s  a  lot  of  people  who  don’t  like  me  for  ending  a  relationship  I  was  in  like  three  years  ago.I  was  fucked  up  on  Xanax  the  whole  time  and  was  not  myself  at  all.  I  detoxed  cold  turkey  and  realized  drinking  smoking  and  popping  pills  was  not  what  I  wanted  to  do  all  day  everyday.
__label__m _U  Word  of  wisdom  from  Sister  Morphine.👍＞'Maybe  the  most  that  you  can  expect  from  a  relationship  that  goes  bad  is  to  come  out  of  it  with  a  few  good  songs'
__label__c Even  if  only  very  briefly.  I've  had  to  take  valium.  Waiting  for  it  to  kick  in.
__label__m fda  approves  oxycontin  for  children  as  young  as  11  but  heaven  forbid  we  consider  medical  marijuana!
__label__a coffee  and  adderall  are  my  only  weapons  against  depression.  or  so  it  would  seem
__label__a i  just  want  to  download  my  goddamned  discourses  that  i  find  so  fucking  peaceful...now  i  need  a  xanax  and  a  bowl
__label__m _U  xanax  is  over  rated.  codeine  is  where  the  action  is  lol
__label__u kevin  gates  ft  lyrica  anderson  :  feenin  😏😏😏😍
__label__a i  took  an  adderall  &  chugged  a  rock  star  energy  so  that's  how  my  nights  going
__label__c _U  hey  man,  ive  been  there  and  its  shit  :(  they  put  me  on  clonazepam  and  it  helped  for  a  while.  talk  therapy/CBT  also  helped.  but  i  have  hope  you  can  get  through  this  and  come  out  stronger.  i  love  you  as  a  person  and  your  music  too.  stay  safe,  you’ve  got  this  💕
__label__c _U  yeah,  seroquel  xr  can  make  things  a  bit  muddy  sometimes.  i  haven't  had  that  problem  since  i  switched  from  zyprexa  to  geodon.
__label__m all  i've  been  hearing  today  is  how  people  are  doing  xanax  at  school...  okay?
__label__m Xanax  mana  Xanax?
__label__c Ordered  pizza.  Adderall.  Watching  Ocean’s  Thirteen.  Diesel  Jeans.
__label__m Just  drown  me  in  Valium
__label__c _U  _U  _U  Cannabiss  worked  for  me  unfortunately  I  tried  the  methadone  way  and  it  is  corrupt  and  the  goal  is  not  to  ween  patients  off.Methadone  is  very  nasty  drug...
__label__m “_U:  _U  thanks.  can  you  tell  the  photographer  to  get  wider  shots  next  time?  #seavssd”  make  sure  ur  db  unit  has  their  adderall
__label__a i  might  have  accidentally  overdosed  on  xanax
__label__c oh  this  morphine  tho  🙃💉💊  night
__label__a someone  give  me  their  adderall  😂
__label__c _U  pulled  a  muscle  in  top  of  me  right  arse  cheek  and  down  me  leg  been  on  co-  codamol  ibuprofen  and  tramadol  all  week  haha
__label__m _U  They  gave  you  shot  of  morphine  which  they’ve  had  for  ever.  Not  all  ppl  that  use  pain  pills  get  addicted
__label__m _U  _U  _U  And  substance  abuse  -  put  a  valium  addict  who  is  out  of  valium  alone  in  a  room  with  a  gun  and  you  will  get  a  suicide.
__label__m finals  week:  adderal  and  vyvanse  are  everyone's  bestfriend!
__label__m _U  Hahaha.  I’m  on  Provigil.  Safer,  less  addictive.  It’s  for  swing  shift  disorder.  My  son  is  12,  I  wanna  avoid  narcotics  at  all  cost.  But  yes  adderall  is  great.  I  would’ve  been  a  scholar  if  I  knew  about  it  before  high  school
__label__m Gabapentin,  a  drug  that  treats  nerve  pain  and  is  commonly  prescribed  for  chronic  pain,  is  only  effective  for  1  in  6  patients.  I've  seen  PNE  have  a  drastic  effect  on  some  of  my  patients.  It's  by  no  means  the  only  solution,  but  it  should  be  a  (more)  important  piece  of  the  puzzle.
__label__m _U  adderall  is  an  amphetamine,  which  is  a  stimulant,  and  alcohol  is  a  depressant,  do  they  counteract  😅
__label__c i  always  get  semi  terrified  when  they  up  my  adderall  dose.  😳👯🙇🙎🙆💃🙏
__label__c _U  for  sure.  i've  been  taking  adderall  on  &  off  for  ~10  years  -  how  much  i  need  has  varied  up  &  down  quite  a  bit.
__label__a _U  Fuck  me  I’ll  throw  in  a  couple  diazepam  too
__label__m _U  Is  tramadol  not  a  pain  reliever  how  can  it  make  one  faint  Na  so  Una  go  dey  spread  fake  stories
__label__m _U  _U  the  term  feminism  has  run  far  far  away  to  a  land  of  crazy  bitches  who  need  a  fucking  blunt  or  xanax
__label__c _U  seroquel  and  zoloft,i  had  no  idea  where  i  was,slurred  speech,dui,absolutely  no  alcohol!!!car  in  a  cow  pasture.blame  the  doctors!!!
__label__m wish  i  asked  my  doctor  for  klonopin  so  i  can  chill  the  fuck  out  for  once
__label__m Highly  recommend  taking  adderall  💕
__label__m _U  #TheResistance  _U  _U  She  looks  like  she  may  be  stoned  on  valium.
__label__m Yellow  Suboxone-rine  #AddDrugsImproveAnything
__label__m adderall  is  the  most  casual  drug  of  our  generation.  behind  molly  that  is
__label__m _U  taking  someone  off  150mg  off  seroquel,  mixing  it  with  olanzapine  in  2  wks  causes  psychosis  -  a  proper  assess  was  not  done.
__label__m ativan  to  buy  in  canada
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Think  i  called  her  out  though...  She  didnt  argue  the  xanax  lmao
__label__c oxycodone  did  a  great  job,  feeling  much  better  now.  💊😀
__label__c ah  well  sleep  time  meds  done  v  itchy  now  tramadol  duloxetine  n  codeine  evil  mix  wish  they  bloody  helped  ah  well  _U  it  is  nitex
__label__m _U  _U  dollar  per  pill?    hard  pass!  it's  probably  soy  powder  in  a  gel  cap.    snort  some  adderall  like  a  man!
__label__c adderall  got  me  creating  an  elaborate  mythology  on  the  origins  of  the  mysterious  old  hispanic  man  who  is  permanently  at  the  local  campus  bar
__label__m Honestly  so  annoyed  seeing  articles  saying  lil  peep  overdosed  on  Xanax,  it  was  Xanax  and  Fentyal  and  fentyal  is  a  super  deadly  drug  when  mixed...  so  if  it  was  just  Xanax  tbh  he  woulda  be  fine  (  not  promoting  Xanax  js)
__label__m Not  surprised  how  fast  the  OxyContin  opioid  epidemic  is  getting  coverage  and  justice..
__label__a pretty  sure  i'm  addicted  to  morphine  now  😐💉
__label__m remember  guys  adderall    shows  up  as  meth  on  a  drug  test  :/
__label__m _U  You  can't  go  drunk.  But,  apparently,  quite  a  few  go  on  a  valium  or  two.
__label__m _U  Probably  not.  Outside  of  OxyContin  there  isn’t  a  stronger  pill  based  pain  killer  afaik.
__label__c _U  Thank  you.  I  thought  I  was  losing  my  mind  because  I  could  never  sleep  when  taking  Tramadol.  Never  dawned  on  me  it  was  the  medication.
__label__c i  blame  xanax  for  making  me  forget  to  shave  one  whole  leg
__label__a _U  hell  yeah  nicca  we  of  2  xanax  and  smokin  loud  you  betta  stream  my  nicca
__label__u Mighty  Morphine  Power  Rangers  were  illegally  okay  and  I  lick  a  dog  anus  to  create  my  smaller-than-average  foreskin.
__label__c quetiapine  just  makes  me  want  to  sleep  #inthemind  #mentalhealth
__label__c this  tramadol  feel  like  a  xannie  😳
__label__m Vicodin  and  OxyContin  I  heartily  agree  with  you  Daniil  as  they’ve  become  the  biggest  drug  problem  in  the  USA.  They  are  more  euphoric  than  heroin,  cause  less  desire  to  puke  and  are  being  pushed  like  dealers  push  smack.  Opiates  should  ONLY  be  prescribed  for  short  term  use.
__label__c _U  (2)  Altogether  it  was  about  eight  hours  of  the  worst  physical  agony  ever.    FINALLY  they  shot  me  full  of  morphine,  and  the  pain  stopped.
__label__m By  July  5th....  A  last  meal,  a  bottle  of  sailor  jerrys  rum,  3  "xanax"  bars  likely  etizolam,  and  finally  100$  worth  of  the  local  heroin.  That  should  be  enough  for  my  goal...  I'd  rather  find  a  better  option,  but  it  requires  the  help  of  a  team  of  doctors  I'll  never  find
__label__c _U  can  i  just  have  the  xanax?  having  to  choose  between  anxiety  meds  or  adhd  meds  got  me  choosing  adderall  every  time!  lol
__label__m Damn  Lilt  Zero  is  so  good.  That  and  fathead  pizza  are  like  my  methadone  for  kicking  carbs.  #keto  #ketogenic
__label__m _U  The  girl  dier  she  Dey  on  some  Tramadol.  Forget  am
__label__c _U  yeah  i  take  quetiapine
__label__a _U  _U    So  I’m  clear  -  Should  I  take  a  Valium  and  drive?  Or  drink  and  take  a  Valium?
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Actually  on  the  scale  of  medications  for  pain,  Tramadol  is  pretty  mild,  it’s  not  a  heavyweight  pain  killer.
__label__m i  hear  the  xanax  callin
__label__c _U  _U  I  hope  you  don't  mind  me  replying  to  this  but  me  too!  I'm  allergic  to  opioids  but  can  just  about  tolerate  dihydrocodeine.  Allergic  to  pregabalin.  Allergic  to  NSAIDs.  So  shit!
__label__m _U  exactly..  lol  a  nobody  ass  rapper  dude  thats  overdosed  on  xanax.
__label__m Future  is  Shaggy  if  he  went  to  the  future  and  took  an  autotuned  xanax.
__label__m _U  but  it's  just  klonopin  and  beta  blockers  😭  i  need  a  hoodlum  stat
__label__c well,  the  slow  release  morphine  worked  for  around  7  hours....i  spose  that's  better  than  nothing...
__label__m _U  _U  magical  thinking.  Try  Seroquel
__label__a Omagad  it  rhymes!  I  wrote  a  poem  while  high  on  oxycontin
__label__m you  don't  know  my  struggle,  so  you  can't  feel  my  hustle..  unless  you're  on  vyvanse
__label__a i  had  3  cups  of  coffee  and  my  adderall  this  morning  and  i  feel  like  jimmy  neutron  boy  fucking  genius
__label__m _U  Twitter  and  other  social  networks  could  certainly  function  as  replacement  therapies,  but  like  methadone,  no  long  term  fix.
__label__m _U  _U  Because  rape  and  adderall  usage  are  totally  the  same  things...
__label__m _U  Still  look  like  a  mad  tramp  you  see  collecting  her  methadone
__label__c Can  never  tell  if  it’s  the  Prozac  or  Seroquel  that  gives  me  dry  mouth
__label__m _U  _U  WHO.  CARES.    Genuinely.    Who.  Gives.  A.  Fuck.  It's  idiots  tramadol.    Wake  the  fuck  up.
__label__c not  okay.  crying  in  bed  after  a  somewhat  productive  morning.  need  reassurance  &  help  w  chores.  klonopin  +  💦  =  #betterlivingthroughchemistry
__label__m Scientific  research  tell  us  that  Mariguana  is  the  least  toxic  drug  in  pharmacology.  Morphine/Opioids  are  the  most  toxic/addictive,  but  governments  aid  big  pharma  in  the  peddling  of  Morphine/Opioid  derivatives.
__label__a if  i  had  to  describe  my  night  in  two  words  they  would  be  vyvanse  and  coffee
__label__m _U  _U  I  canny  wait  especially  to  see  Methadone  Mick
__label__m _U  but  just  do  moli  then  adderall  is  so  bad  for  you  lol
__label__m idc  _U  would've  never  died  from  od  unless  it  was  given  to  him  w/out  him  knowing!  fentanyl  is  bad  hydrocodone  was  mislabeled
__label__m deny  them;  they  will  come  in    brood  and  illegally  send  a  syringe    within  your  veins,  of  course    unknowing  what  the  #poison  actually  is,    for  there  is  no  mention  of  what  substance  is  being  injected.    #risperidone  is  a  common  one,  as  is  #haldol
__label__u I  have  to  say  this  the  first  time  I’ve  felt  real  emotion  on  this  show!      #lhhh  lyrica
__label__m Have  Depression?Yes?You  suffer  from  OCD.This  causes  numbness.Try  Adderall
__label__m _U  Somebody  give  that  woman  a  Valium.  Geez!  Smh
__label__a adderall  &  redbull  are  going  to  keep  me  alive  and  awake  today  #merryxmas2014🎄
__label__m Fell  asleep  reading  Zog.  Mrs  K  said  it  sounded  like  Madam  Dragon  was  dosed  up  on  Diazepam  towards  the  end.
__label__m _U  It's  his  morphine.
__label__c klonopin  pls  fuckin  work  so  i  can  calm  the  fuck  down  for  once
__label__c Need  to  take  a  Valium  before  riding  with  my  husband  .  Geesh
__label__m Look  up  The  Phoenix  Project.  Phony  marketing  by  phar  companies  claiming  the  non  addictive  qualities  of  Oxycodone  in  the  late  70’s      The  medical  community  got  duped  by  big  pharma.
__label__m vyvanse  is  the  worst  best  drug  out  there
__label__m shawty  went  to  the  grocery  store  tryna  buy  a  xanax
__label__m the  first  kardashian  season  compared  to  now..  it's  so  forced  and  fake  now...  khloe  was  doing  coke  and  xanax  on  tv  lol
__label__m _U  famous  words  of  an  adderall  addict.  peace  g  ✌🏽
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  You  seem  unaware  that  this  drug  was  heavily  marketed  by  this  family  to  physicians  as  totally  safe  and  non-addictive.  That  is  a  central  issue  here.    Oxycontin  is  anything  but  non-addictive  and  they  knew  that.  They  did  plenty  wrong.
__label__m adderal  to  stay  focused,  xanax  to  take  the  edge  off,  pot  to  mellow  me  out,  cocaine  to  wake  me  back  up  again  &  morphine  well  bc  its  awesome  😂
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Sometimes  I  mutter  under  my  breath  "dammit  Seth"  when  I'm  documenting  on  an  rx  after  contacting  the  doctor  like  "MD  aware  of  allergy,  ok  to  fill"  or  "MD  aware  of  tramadol  ok  to  fill  perc"
__label__c still  haven't  slept  thank  you  adderall
__label__m _U  _U  She  didn't  apparently,  they  were  obtained  from  "a  friend".  Is  that  not  illegal  possession  in  the  UK  as  Tramadol  is  a  controlled  drug?  Who  is  the  "friend"?  I  think  they  have  questions  to  answer  also.
__label__u lyrica  better  stop  allat  cause  you  sleep  with  a1  not  your  mom  ,  she  gon  always  be  ur  mom  ,  but  sometimes  moms  be  hating  she  need  some🍆  #lhhh
__label__m Your  desire  to  satisfy  your  girlfriend  using  tramadol  is  your  sure  ticket  to  the  grave.      #StopTramadolAbuse
__label__c Thank  god  for  morphine  post  surgery.
__label__m having  street  venders  handing  out  free  methadone  to  ppl  without  heroin  problems  is  absurd.  they  put  people  on  methadone  over  minor  stuff.
__label__m Valium,  anyone?  #MalaysiaGP  #f1  #verstappen
__label__m Also  notable  that  Xanax  &  benzodiazepines  are  as  popular  as  they  are,  though  they're  less  visible  because  less  likely  to  kill.  But  people  can  take  them  for  similar  reasons  to  opiates
__label__m _U  when  are  you  gonna  impregnate  me  and/or  hafsa  so  we  can  have  children  named  chanel  and  xanax

__label__a aaannddd  there's  no  water  here.  so  it  looks  like  i'm  taking  my  adderall  with  coffee.  this  won't  end  badly  at  all.

__label__m _U  _U  How  much  can  I  pay  your  social  media  manager  to  quite  abusing  Xanax?

__label__c Yes,  after  my  TAH  I  had  a  night  of  vomiting  after  being  encouraged  to  walk  the  nursing  floor  hours  after  surgery,  getting  stuck  in  my  bed  that  night,  (no  nurse  came  when  called)  &  then  I  was  taken  off  morphine  less  than  24  hours  after  surgery  &  told  would  only  be  given  Tylenol  3.

__label__c The  question  is  do  I  take  adderall  to  stay  awake  on  this  lovely  day  or  do  I  just  nap
__label__c wonder  if  quetiapine  causes  brain  damage....somethings  fucked  me  up  and  it  may  be  that.  i'm  not  stopping  it  tho
__label__m Tylenol  get  her  lit  af  if  you  tell  her  it’s  a  hydrocodone
__label__c Nothing  flloors  me  more  than  sciatica    Holy  shit    Apparently  this  happens  to  THR  patients  2-3  weeks  after  because  while  your  swelling  is  going  down,  your  pelvic/sacral  bone  did  just  shift  a  whole  lot  so  stuff  has  to  settle.    Glad  I  have  a  stash  of  Lyrica  AND  gabapentin,  Jesus.

__label__m Only  busters  still  do  Xanax
__label__c In  order  for  my  shrink  to  drug  me  with  enough  petrochemical  to  drown  a  squirrel  he  must  provide  me  with  enough  Valium  to  choke  a  horse.  One  can  be  sold  on  the  open  market.  The  othe  must  be  financed  by  the  govt.  80%  startups  fail.  Druggies.

__label__m Adderall  documentary  on  Netflix
__label__m rich  conservatives  don't  see  the  problem  with  drug  testing  the  poor  because  when  they  wanna  get  high  their  doctor  just  writes  a  xanax  script

__label__m _U  _U  why  is  the  diazepam  inside  a  dildo?
__label__m my  mother  has  cellulitis,  so  her  doc  gave  her  hydrocodone  for  the  pain.  lucky.
__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  herion,  morphine,  suddenly,  I’m  a  fiend  and  you’re  all  I  need
__label__m _U  It  is  best  to  use  methadone,  slowly,  reduce  the  doasge  over  time  and  then  have  the  person  detox,  recovery  and  supports  after  recovery.
__label__a So  I  thought  if  I  took  two  of  my  vyvanse  I  would  be  more  focused..  I  swear  I'm  a  second  away  from  cardiac  arrest
__label__a _U  took  too  much  valium  and  napped

__label__m _U  _U  the  diazepam  injection  in  the  car  &  iv  at  chelsea's  must've  worked.  she's  healthy  though.  nothing  to  see  here.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  i  am  on  too  strong  of  meds  between  the  fentanyl  and  oxycodone  and  lyrica  i  barely  know  my  name
__label__m _U  _U  I'm  mad  that  I  read,  "It's  morphine  time"!

__label__c _U  i  want  to  stay  away  from  tranqs  since  it  was  partially  seroquel  that  got  me  into  this  mess
__label__a I  was  on  Oxycodone  and  Oxycontin  for  4yrs  for  chronic  pain  (NJ)  before  moving  to  OR  5yrs  ago.  I  couldn't  get  my  meds  here,  ended  up  at  a  methadone  clinic.  Now  at  2mg  Suboxone,  using  mj  to  titrate  off  of  it  and  I  feel  ok.  At  60  I've  found  that  pot  over  pills  really  does  work.  TY.
__label__a who  has  adderall  seriously  i  could  really  use  some  because  i  apparently  suck  at  sleeping.
__label__m _U  you're  not  a  failure.  if  the  olanzapine  will  help  then  take  it
__label__m How  was  my  day,  you  ask?  I  looked  at  my  coworkers  after  we'd  only  been  open  for  an  hour  and  said  -  "I  need  a  Xanax,  a  Summer  Shandy,  and  a  fuckin  nap."    My  sister  is  the  real  MVP  for  actually  bringing  me  a  six-pack  after  she  left.  Lord,  beer  me  strength.  #shedlife
__label__c _U  I've  been  taking  Valium  and  Clonopin  for  20  years  it's  never  caused  me  to  go  out  and  shoot  anybody  fuck  that  noise
__label__c Speaking  of  concerts,  recently  I  found  out  from  an  old  friend,  that  we  saw  _U  in  the  late  90s  in  Golden  Gate  Park.  I  have  no  memory  of  it.  I  broke  my  back  shortly  after  &  was  put  on  Oxycontin.  I  lost  a  lot  of  memories  &  more  from  that  stuff  not  helping  me  really  recover
__label__c way  too  many  spontaneous  purchases  on  adderall  lately    😳
__label__m i'm  not  sure  if  i  should  be  watching  #mrrobot.  i  like  the  show  but  he  does  morphine  and  i'm  really  fucking  jealous.
__label__m Have  an  aversion  to  tight  spaces?Yes?You  suffer  from  Pre-Menstrual  Syndrome.This  causes  bones  to  dissolve.Try  Abilify
__label__m _U  it's  always  been  in  pill  form.  that's  what  methadone  is  essentially

__label__m _U  I  BET  MOM  DRINKS,  smokes  pot,  eats  valium  &  does  the  pool  guy  once  a  month..OMG..that's  my  ex  mother  in  law!

__label__m _U  he's  been  targeting  a  bunch  of  people  through  the  ht,  b/c  he  was  dependent  on  xanax  once,  so  all  psych  meds  are  bad.
__label__m _U  I'm  sure  t  rump  needed  a  Valium  because  sonny  boy  was  being  '  interviewed'  as  were  his  deutsche  bank  records.

Tried  all  sorts  of  psych  meds,  including  a  very  low  dose  of  Seroquel  (25mg),  which  helped  with  sleep.

__label__m _U  _U  Just  cannabis  or  something  else  too  (ie  methadone)?
__label__m i  say  this  all  the  time  too,  i  don't  think  it's  nothing  wrong  with  u  popping  a  bar  in  your  wild  days.  but  xanax  addition  is  crack  addiction.

__label__m _U  I  think  they  need  "anger  management"......  or  a  Xanax.
__label__c Oh  wow,  having  a  big  panic  attack,  not  doing  so  well.    Could  really  use  more  Diazepam,  seems  to  be  the  only  thing  that  stops  it.    :(

__label__m _U  Read:  methadone  for  Left  Wing  Mental  Patients  post  failed  coup
__label__m _U  Your  recent  article  refers  to  all  three  medications  as  “the  gold  standard”.  However,  unless  something  has  changed,  methadone  is  the  only  one  of  the  three  actually  referred  to  in  the  literature  as  the  gold  standard

__label__a adderall  makes  me  feel  like  i'm  the  smartest  person  to  ever  live  when  i'm  on  it  😍
__label__c I  was  absent  from  class  because  of  surgery  and  have  my  makeup  test  tomorrow  but  I  literally  don't  know  anything  about  what's  on  it  because  (obviously)  I've  been  in  the  hospital  and  I've  had  literally  no  time  to  catch  up  and  study  after  being  on  morphine  for  a  week  and  I'm  like  😭
__label__m _U  ummmmmmmmm  is  900mg  of  gabapentin  your  regular  dose?
__label__c i  get  hyper  focused  sometimes  when  i  take  my  adderall  and  i  just  sit  for  hours  in  silence  thinking  of  things  to  do  but  not  do  any  of  it  😂
__label__u I  had  no  idea  Lyrica  from  love  and  hip  hop  Hollywood  song  be  on  the  radio  ....  this  shit  a  smash  too  🔥🔥🔥🔥🌊

__label__m some  candidates  were  able  to  compare  &  contrast  btwn  civil  case  n  criminal  case..but  some  fail  to  justify  under  which  category  oxycontin
__label__m _U  opioids,  such  as heroin,  are  made  by  adding  a  chemical  to  morphine.  Today,  many  drugs  in  the  opioid  category  don't  actually  come  from  opium.
__label__m _U  Sorry  lads  might  be  my  age  but  I  just  couldn’t  listen  to  them,  lyrics  so  depressing  like  Adele  on  Valium
__label__m xanax  a  full  time  job
__label__m _U  _U  _U  I  think  this  explaina  your  Adderall  addiction
__label__m I'm  obssesed  with    room    on  Xanax
__label__c _U  surprisingly  no  i  think  i  hyperfocus  more  when  i'm  not  on  adderall  which  is  a  symptom  of  actual  adhd  so  idk
__label__c I  forget  how  nausea  I  get  when  I  take  tramadol  and  stay  up  later  than  normal  after  taking  it  lol  at  me
__label__m Have  general  forgetfulness?You  probably  have  Premature  Ejaculations.This  causes  denial.Try  Methadone
__label__c _U  Agree  with  you  on  this  account  completely  I  have  Neuropathy  and  I  take  Gabapentin  for  the  pain  that  results  from  it.  You  would  be  surprised  how  many  times  I  have  to  have  Bipolar  disorder  removed  from  my  medical  records  by  a  court  order.  I've  sued  over  it  many  times.
__label__m dude,  adderall  is  like  mollys  little  sister.
__label__a _U  adderall  and  or  coke?  i  think  yas  bitch
__label__m um  jules,  everyone  knows  that  adderall  makes  u  lose  weight.  i  know  u  know  that  #rhony
__label__m i  deadass  havent  slept  all  night  i  feel  like  im  off  adderall  or  coke
__label__a i  need  some  adderall  for  next  week.  got  finals

And  a  failed  marketing  plan  for  #suboxone;  because  they  “just  make  Lysol”.
__label__c i  can't  believe  its  legal  for  me  to  take  vyvanse  but  not  smoke  weed.  stupid  world.
__label__m xanax  and  patron  i'll  never  be  alone.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Baby  Valium.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  Me  too.  My  left  leg  feels  like  a  dead  weight.  Also  have  fibromyalgia.    Switching  to  Gabapentin,  because  I  don't  think  Lyrica  is  working  anymore😢
__label__c i  wish  i  could  drink.  too  bad  i'm  on  oxycodone
__label__c _U  not  too  bad  ta.  morphine  keeps  going  up  until  the  needle  on  a  60's  B  movie  temperature  scale  is  hovering  over  red.  going  to  a  pain  clinic,  cant  take  fentanyl  or  oxycodone  coz  of  the  hiv  drugs  bit  can  get  on  to  tramadol.  fingers  crossed
__label__c gabapentin  puts  me  to  sleep
__label__a I  havent  snorted  adderall  in  days  man
__label__c the  seroquel  is  a  borderline  si  for  me  but  i  feel  #fake  bc  my  mom  kept  yelling  at  me  in  the  headspace  aksamklg,.
__label__m _U  _U  ...and  its  still  probably  a  lot  safer  than  lyrica
__label__a Lost  3  days  to  Xanax  last  week  but  i  think  i  made  the  most  fire  drill  beat  ever💥
__label__c _U  What  the  hell  is  wrong  with  people?  i  was  on  oxycodone  for  two  weeks  after  double  surgery  and  got  off  without  being  addicted.  That  was  two  yrs  ago.
__label__a *takes  vyvanse*  “My  brain  feels  like  the  internet”
__label__a Pretty  sure  I  keep  losing  my  xanax  more  than  I  pop  one.
__label__a The  come  down  of  Adderall  is  really  horrible  and  the  only  option  I  have  is  to  either  sleep  or  take  more
__label__m _U  Ask  about  Gabapentin  or  Lyrica  for  the  neuropathy.
__label__c just  got  off  the  phone  with  my  doctors  office  about  my  lyrica  (first  meds  i  got  off  of)  they  had  problems  with  the  preauth  and  never  called
__label__m why  do  i  jeep  seeing  adderall  side  effect  pages.
__label__m _U  Legal  in  the  UK  you  say!  Without  a  prescription  it  is  2  years  in  prison.  Supplying,  as  she  was  doing,  is  up  to  14  years  in  prison,  in  the  UK  #Tramadol  #talktofrank
__label__m my  mom  is  still  trying  to  say  xanax  makes  you  fat.
__label__c _U  I  just  want  low  dosage  valium,  that's  all
__label__c took  an  adderall  and  all  i  could  focus  on  was  you
__label__c _U  *blushes!*    thank  you!    it  just  sorta  happened,  because  i  take  a  lot  of  amphetamines  :-p  (i  started  adderall  a  few  months  ago)

__label__m _U  _U  Is  like  they  have  not  planted  bullet  or  tramadol  in  your  car  before.  Experience  na  the  best  teacher
__label__m bibby  pops  seroquel  lol
__label__m _U  but  why  ?  morphine  isnt  good  :(
__label__c _U:  time  to  try  these  new  pill  gabapentin    :@  hope  they  work  better
__label__m If  the  pre-teen  years  are  anything  to  go  by,  when  this  kid  hits  her  teens  I’m  going  to  need  a  dangerous  amount  of  1)  alcohol,  and  2)  Xanax.
__label__c I've  had  2  Tramadol  and  for  the  last  5  mins  I  thought  Liverpool  were  playing  in  red  😶
__label__m _U  Still  annoys  me  that  the  verve  aren't  a  band  anymore  even  though  am  a  fan  of  your  solo  work.  Listening  to  northern  soul  and  forth  of  late  and  the  songs  you  wrote  were  ridiculously  good.  Tunes  like  Colombo,  judas,  valium  skies,  stormy  clouds  are  so  uplifting
__label__c _U  _U  _U  LOL  that  morphine  was  so  good
__label__m _U  _U  Pfizer-  lyrica..  You  don’t  want  to  go  there
__label__c in  the  interest  of  full  disclosure,  i  took  an  oxycodone  like  half  an  hour  ago  but  that  is  not  why  i'm  so  into  myself  right  now,  i  promise.
__label__a Since  I’m  sick  I’m  about  to  go  to  work  and  steal  a  IV  Bag  And  Some  Morphine
__label__c all  i  want  for  christmas  is  my  ex  adderall  dealer  (doctor)  to  be  covered  under  my  new  insurance.
__label__m _U  they  don't  know  what  is  causing  the  chest  pains,  but  she's  on  morphine  surrounded  by  nurses.
__label__m —  shoulders  and  leaned  in  her  head  and  showcased  her  pearly  whites  when  the  graduating  class  had  tossed  the  caps  up  in  the  valium  colored  —
__label__a i  ain't  poppin  adderall  nomore,  starting  to  hate  this  shit
__label__c _U  no  ma'am  i'm  on  vyvanse  i'm  about  to  take  zzz-quil  then  😴
__label__u 90s  kids  be  like  pogs  mighty  morphine  power  rangers  mario  cart  my  parents  did  ecstacy  for  marriage  counseling  and  got  a  divorce  surge  soda!!
__label__a My  whole  day  gon  be  ruined  Ima  smoke  all  day  ,  take  this  xanax  and  sleep  til  Tuesday.
__label__m _U  _U  Also  bupe  or  methadone  standard  of  care  *in  jail  or  prison*  in  most  other  countries  with  high  rates  OUD
__label__c _U  don't  feel  like  methadone
__label__c 1.  Kratom  IS  NOT  A  DRUG.  2.  If  they  try  to  restrict  Imodium,  I  will  be  unable  to  manage  my  IBS.  3.  If  they  try  to  restrict  my  Xanax,  I'll  likely  become  non-functional  and  end  up  in  the  ER  frequently  for  panic  attacks,  where  I  suppose  they'll  tell  me  to  meditate.  STOP.  THIS.  NOW.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Joe  you  poor  fellow.  Maybe  a  doctor  could  prescribe  some  Valium  for  you.
__label__m This  chipmunk  needs  Valium!
__label__m _U  Got  to  be  choosing  the  know  alcohol  and  Valium  addict  who’s  last  heart  attack  was  less  than  two  years  ago  to  be  your  running  mate
__label__c do  i  take  some  adderall  or  go  to  bed?!  idk  idk  idk
__label__m When  I  go  to  bed  sober,  I  dream  of  my  late  hub  in  present  day.  Last  night  he  took  a  sales  job  for  a  corp  dog  food  company  but  never  smiled.  His  real  life  was  morphine  pumps.  Until  a  French  company  swooned  him  into  a  scandal..  life  totally  sucks.  Sorry  for  the  vent.
__label__a and  no  it's  not  a  22  year  old  lad  who  calls  me  mum  and  sells  me  Valium
__label__m can  y'all  stop  making  these  xanax  eating  women  abusers  famous??
__label__c Why  it  feel  like  I  just  took  some  adderall?  I  havent  took  that  in  years  lol

__label__m _U  a  guy  suspended  for  adderall  has  the  balls  to  call  out  someone  else?  why  do  we  care  what  a  cheater  says  about  cheating?
__label__m _U  just  jerking  your  chain  buddy.  pop  two  xanax  and  call  me  in  the  morning.
__label__a sats  are  coming  up  which  means  adderall  👏
__label__a _U  _U  _U  i  wish  i  had  adderall  bc  i  have  zero  pages  of  this  paper  done  after  idk...  7  hours?

__label__a diazepam,  codeine  and  coffee  can  only  mean  one  thing  -  exam  week  at  university  🤣
__label__a By  the  end  of  the  day  I  will  have  30  #tempazapam,  30  #valium,  40  #Xanax  and  6  Es.  Oh,  and  some  #hash.    Strictly  no  alcohol.    One  way  to  get  over  suicidal  ideation.
__label__m _U  I'll  have  to  google  Zyprexa.  Thanks!
__label__c xanax  be  the  only  thing  keeping  me  from  killing  half  of  these  niggas  😳
__label__m Everyone  watch  Take  Your  Pills  on  Netflix  !!!  It’s  so  good..  didn’t  realize  how  many  ppl  abuse  adderall
__label__c read  the  leaflet  with  my  aripiprazole  and  it  says  that  fluoxetine  increases  of  aripiprazole  in  your  system.  how  did  the  doctor  not  know??
__label__c Out  is  storm  and  very  windy  with  rain....  I  do  not  know  why  I  have  anxiety...  bad  anxiety..  I  have  heart  beating  and  headache..  I  took  2mg  Lorazepam..  I  think  something  bad  wants  happen,  but  I  don't  know  why  doesn't  happen?

__label__c i  feel  like  the  adderall  wore  off  when  i  get  in  the  shower  maybe  i'm  tripping  but  i  need  a  5  hour  energy
__label__m _U  Not  when  you’re  prescribed  Valium.
__label__u ariela  barer  and  lyrica  okano  are  girlfriends  js
__label__m xanax  when  not  abused  and  used  as  prescribed  honestly  works  wonders  man,  y'all  are  just  stupid  as  fuck
__label__m _U  let’s  ask  your  adderall
__label__a _U  _U  Needed  Valium  as  well  as  strongbow  half  time,  terrible  first  half!!  👊  Fans  booing  them  off  must  have  sparked  life.  We  said  same  thing  today,  same  old,  very  sad.  See  you  at  Derby  Wednesday,  glutton  for  punishment  me  😃  xx
__label__a two  red  bulls  and  an  adderall  later  and  I  could  still  take  a  nap  wtf
__label__c quit  xanax  cold  turkey  three  months  ago  and  still  haven’t  touched  it  🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
__label__m stop  taking  xanax  and  pills  in  general  please.
__label__c adderall  you  save  me
__label__a i  got  xanax  and  weed,  night  gon  be  smooth
__label__c _U  night  nurses  have  often  been  interesting  characters.  When  I  was  in  Derby  Royal  for  my  appendectomy,  I  hallucinated  mine  was  a  6ft  tall  cockroach.  Morphine  or  not,  it  turned  out  to  be  close  to  the  truth.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  he  died  from  fentanyl  not  xanax.  and  he  didn't  know  it  was  fentanyl
__label__a just  popped  4  adderall  5  klonapin  and  12  norcos  and  smoked  a  gram  of  kush............  hey  im  prescirbed
__label__m _U  Amazinggg!  I  was  prescribed  some  for  my  flight  cause  I  can’t  have  Valium,  are  they  actually  likely  to  help  at  all?
__label__a found  a  xanax  on  the  floor  at  work.
__label__a my  body  runs  on  a  complex  mixture  of  caffeine,  cold  medicine,  adderall  and  alcohol  throughout  the  course  of  the  week
__label__c beer  has  stopped  tasting  good.  i  blame  generic  adderall
__label__m i  refuse  to  take  the  oxycodone  for  my  pain,    but  i'm  hurting  alot..i  can  barely  move.
__label__m Now  we  know  the  shooter  was  taking  a  known  drug  to  cause  aggression  Valium  _U    _U    _U
__label__c my  wish  to  sleep  will  be  granted  by  quetiapine.  in  half  an  hour.  this'll  take  a  while.
__label__c _U  _U  Ironically  lorazepam  worked  great  for  me  for  temporary  relief  from  anxiety  attacks.  Tried  not  to  think  about  how  it  was  the  pill  I  tried  to  OD  on  in  my  suicide  attempt.
__label__m spyro-  especially  the  stone  dragons  that  hatch,  swatches,  fluffy  cats  with  very  soft  paws  (like  mine,  her  name  is  sketch),  XANAX
__label__m _U  when  _U  gets  home  run  his  bath  &  give  him  a  duckie  &  after  some  milk  and  valium  call  his  mommy
__label__m I  think  this  bitch  really  just  pretended  to  give  me  my  morphine  shot...  no  fucking  joke.    Like  she  rushed  through  the  initial  flush,  said  we  were  gonna  do  the  morphine  super  slow  (its  only  2  fuckin  mg,  how  can  you  do  that  slowww??)  Had  her  hand  over  the  whole  syringe  and  I  dont
__label__a i  took  too  much  adderall  and  im  really  sweaty  but  my  house  is  spotless  (u  win  some  u  lose  some)
__label__a almost  forgot  that  i  obtained  an  entire  adderall  script  in  detroit.  blessed.
__label__m I  say  to  that,  Cannabis  is  NOT  EVEN  AN  AGGRESSIVE  SOLUTION!  You  are  doing  the  bidding  of  corporations  who  don't  care  if  their  "CUSTOMERS"  live  a  miserable  life  addicted  to  opioids  OR  DIE!  The  solutions  "THEY"  are  pushing  is  Narcan,  Methadone,  Busting  Doctors  and  Criminalizing
__label__m I  love  my  cousins  but  I  need  a  nap,  a  Xanax,  and  a  bottle  of  tequila  to  remove  all  the  stress  talking  about  my  family  puts  on  my  body
__label__m things  people  learned  while  on  adderall  who  didnt  need  the  drug  to  concentrate  were  essentially  high  on  speed  and  it  doesnt  allow  the  long-term  memory  to  hold  or  even  capture  any  of  the  information
__label__a will  trade  a  motive  for  valium

__label__c I  don’t  really  know  tbh.  They  gave  me  a  second  shot  (2  grains)  of  morphine  and  then  about  15  min  later  I  was  shuffling  off  home.  Assume  it  was  to  their  liking  if  they  let  me  go,  I  didn’t  really  look  after  my  report  here.

It's  scary  2/

__label__m _U  tRump  nation  has  evolved  into  a  hatred  state.  Empowering  racists  with  a  large  dose  of  stupid.  I  suggest  a  steady  diet  of  valium  for  these  red  hat  wearing  #MAGA  disillusioned  tRump  lovers.    Or  free  lobotomies  with  a  tRump  bobble-head  as  a  parting  gift.

__label__m _U  banned  in  2010  for  oxycodone  use.  blamed  it  on  her  coach  supplying  a  painkiller.  flimsy  excuse  from  a  sordid  sprint  team.
__label__m complaining  to  luke  about  trouble  focusing  and  instead  of  suggesting  adderall  or  something  normal  he  suggests  a  small  floating  robot  to  help

__label__m shorty  ate  a  moth  and  popped  a  xanax  wtf  😂
__label__m _U  The  answer  is  insecurity,  mental  illness,  jealousy,  beta  male  syndrome,  sometimes  it’s  meth  or  Xanax  too
__label__c I  have  the  wierdest  dreams  when  i  mix  my  xanax  with  gapapentin.  But  I  also  made  the  best  beat  ever.
__label__c They  were  about  to  put  me  on  gabapentin  but  actually  gabapentin  is  better  for  women  than  lyrica.  Because  its  used  to  also  help  with  hot  flashes  and  stuff  which  men  usually  don't  have  to  deal  with.
__label__m someone  in  work  asked  me  for  methadone  fags  and  i  was  like  um  you  mean  menthol  😂😂

__label__m that's  a  xanax  if  you  don't  understand  me
__label__m I  don't  know  when  people  will  comprehend  that  I  do  not  care  if  they're  mad  at  me.    I'm  not  bothered  that  you're  offended.    Go  get  a  hug  and  a  Valium.
__label__u _U  LITERALLY  ME  TOO  LIKE  I  THAT  IS  MY  FAVORITE  SONG  OFF  THE  ALBUM  AND  LIKE  TAHTS  MY  FAVORITE  LYRICA  I  JUST  CANT

__label__m Will  dropping  coverage  for  OxyContin  help  fight  addiction?  To  vote,  reply  with:  "Yes"  or  "No"  [6/6]
__label__m _U  _U  _U  A  neurologist  told  me  the  same—no  treatment.  She  said,  “so  why  bother  knowing?”  Bc  it  makes  me  appear  less  CRAZY  to  docs!  But,  a  rheumatologist  (nicest  doc  I  have)  said  he  gives  Gabapentin  for  sfpn.
__label__m there  is  not  enough  xanax  in  the  world  to  get  me  through  this  weekend
__label__c honestly  i  hope  my  xanax  and  sleeping  pills  kick  in  &  maybe  i  won't  wake  up  tomorrow  i'm  such  a  fuck  up

__label__m _U  it's  laughter  or  a  xanax  smoothie...or  maybe  a  box  of  wine😜😜😜
__label__a Anxious  from  all  the  Adderall.
__label__m _U  Valium  and  Prednisone.  Interesting  combination.  What  are  you  taking  medication  for?
__label__m _U  That’s  the  exact  opposite  of  the  truth.  It  began  with  whites  in  Appalachia  in  late  90s  when  Purdue  Pharma  came  in  and  pushed  their  new  “non-addictive”  brand  of  oxycodone,  OxyContin,  as  treatment  for  the  chronic  pain  of  coal  miners  and  others  in  rural  E.  KY  &  WV.
__label__m Morphine  shots  plit

__label__m every  dude  who  listens  to  Lil  Peep  would  practically  kill  their  mom  for  a  stash  of  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  Take  your  Xanax  and  what  other  meds  you  require  for  you  MPD,  and  other  unstable  mental  health  issues.  I  would  let  you  clean  my  cats  litter  box.
__label__c got  diagnosed  with  cool  guy  syndrome....  now  i  take  ADDERALL  haha
__label__m why  are  people  taking  oxycodone  &  percocet  for  leisure?  do  y'all  not  care  about  y'all  lives?
__label__m _U  Hydrocodone?    Where!?
__label__m bridge  just  said  that  you  take  xanax  to  help  you  study...  no  sweetie  that's  adderal
__label__m _U  It's  very  effective  when  you  *need*  it.  But  just  like  xanax,  Valium  etc...it  is  NOT  a  recreational  drug.
__label__c _U  _U  I  just  had  my  dosis  of  Klonopin  after  leaving  the  theater.  That’s  all.  🤭🤫
__label__m don't  it  always  seem  to  go  that  you  jet  fuel  you  should  be  xanax  rainer  werner  fassbinder  can't  get  you  off  my  mind.

__label__c _U  _U  I  have  spinal  stenosis  and  was  taking  Vicodin  off  and  on  but  I  hate  the  side  effects  and  honestly  it  was  too  strong.  And  I  can’t  take  NSAIDs  because  they  spike  my  blood  pressure.  Tramadol  is  a  great  alternative  for  minor  pain.
__label__a how  much  adderall  can  i  be  on  max  for  face  to  face  mtng  with  the  gsi  who  already  hates  me
__label__c Ok  update  my  procedure  is  over  im  home  resting  but  i  took  a  couple  of  pics  so  yall  could  see  i  was  in  good  spirits  and  on  valium  oh  they  call  that  my  party  hat

__label__m ATE  PABILI  NG  TATLONG  BANIG  NG  ADDERALL
__label__c girl  i  take  xanax  till  i  ask  you,  what  you  doing  here  ??
__label__c So,  side  effect  of  surgery,  GA,  and  my  general  inability  rn  to  be  in  control  of  WTF  is  going  on  is  I  am  Very  Irate.    Therefore  the  next  human  to  casually  act  as  if  I'm  on  waking  great  doses  of  morphine  for  recreational  purposes,  will  find  my  rage  thrown  in  their  general  direction
__label__m _U  _U  It's  the  adderall  he  takes.
__label__m i  remembered  this  man  used  to  come  to  the  pharmacy  every  week  to  get  his  oxycodone  filled.your  not  in  pain!  who  is  writing  your  scripts?

__label__m #VitalHospice  nurse  Charlotte  was  constantly  telling  family  members  to  give  more  morphine  (opiod)  to  the  patient  to  make  her  comfortable  even  though  there  wasn't  more  pain.  The  pushing  of  opiods  by  hospice  nurses  to  kill  off  a  patient  quickly  is  #StateSanctionedMurder  in  LA
__label__a i  would  like  some  xanax  ☹
__label__m _U  Tramadol  should  do  it  for  you.

__label__a tonight  is  the  night  of  popping  xanax  like  tic  tacs.  don't  @  me
__label__m _U  Methadone  was  involved  in  25-30%  of  OD  deaths  the  last  several  years  consistently  because  of  its  long  half  life.  Methadone  causes  death  via  respiratory  depression  at  therapeutic  doses.  Why  are  you  promoting  this  drug?  There  are  better  SAFER  opiods  approved  for  pain.
__label__m _U  People  on  methadone  have  had  babies  for  years.  It  may  not  be  ‘ideal’,  however,  its  generally  safe,  controlled  and  well  managed.  It  was  unfair  for  them  to  ‘lump’  this  into  their  kōrero  to  bump  the  numbers  up.  Totally  different  situation....

I  finally  realized  on  day  3  it  was  making  me  have  hallucination  dreams  and  gave  me  withdrawals  after  an  hour  of  wearing  off.

__label__m Yeah,  sure.  That's  what  they  said  about  laudanum,  heroin,  cocaine,  and  morphine.  Didn't  they  say  one  time  that  Quaaludes  were  not  addictive  -  like  right  before  they  had  to  take  it  off  the  market  because  people  were  dying?

__label__m _U  _U  _U  where  evidence  based  medicine  has  anything  to  do  with  sauna  or  Gabapentin  Lyrica  being  scripted  evidence  or  long  term  implications  of  use?
__label__m _U  It  is  very  different  to  meth  because  the  doctor  gives  it  to  you  instead  of  a  drug  dealer.  The  same  applies  to  Oxycontin  which  is  nothing  like  heroin  because  again  a  doctor  legally  gives  it  to  you.
__label__m _U  It's  a  nice  theory  but  it  won't  stand  up  to  scrutiny.  Perhaps  you  should  try  it  out  on  the  3  heavily  pregnant  Labour  MPs  who  went  through  lobbies  to  vote  for  a  meaningful  vote  this  week,  one  from  Bradford,  on  morphine  in  a  wheelchair.  Vote  after  vote  Labour  did  their  stuff.
__label__c Once  again  I  find  myself  in  an  ER  because  I  need  pain  management.  This  time  I  get  a  Sub-Q  shot  of  morphine  and  gravol.

__label__m in  other  errata,  after  about  8  weeks  got  the  shed  tidied  &  a  chunk  of  garden  mulched.  valium  rules  the  universe.

__label__c _U  oh,  god.  For  me,  neither  hydrocodone  or  dilaudid  do  anything  for  pain  and  only  make  me  nauseated.  I  never  knew  about  the  link  between  them.

__label__m $HMNY  lagging  for  a  reason,  stopped  out,  swapping  into  $TRVN,  great  news  on  distribution  in  asia  (Japan  and  China)  with  $5MM  in  prepayments.  Hopefully  a  comparable  analgesic  to  morphine  with  less  nausea  and  itching!
__label__c _U  morphine  doesn't  work  on  me  :/

__label__c _U  _U  Ativan  plus  prednisone  used  to  knock  me  out...  may  have  been  the  super  high  blood  sugar  pred  gave  me  though
__label__m _U    haha  think  i  actually  need  a  valium  now,get  a  bit  overexcited  when  it  comes  to  the  weezmeisters!
__label__a how  long  does  the  high  last  &  have  you  tried  oxycodone  ?  _U:  _U  bullshit  .  try  it  .  i  tried  it  on  my  birthday  .  trippy  ."

__label__c Tramadol  shortage  means  no  prescriptions  filled.  Nightmare.  #ChronicPain
__label__m They  should  make  "medication  assisted"  recovery  more  accessible  as  well.  Suboxone  should  be  made  more  accessible.  It  could  save  lives  while  learning  how  to  live  without  drugs.  Fentanyl  is  everywhere  these  days  and  it  doesn't  take  much  to  kill  someone  and  there's  no  way  to  tell.
__label__a studying  is  100000  times  better  w  adderall
__label__m _U  come  back  to  see  that  the  methadone  has  worn  off  and  that  there  in  a  clammy  state  on  the  floor  drinking  alcohol  hand  gel
__label__m this  bitch  said  she  smoked  some  weed  snorted  some  adderall  &  xanax
__label__m _U  great  news,  don't  let  birchy  near  the  morphine
__label__m so  i  know  that  amphetamines  are  banned  in  pro  sports,  but  what  about  athletes  who  are  prescribed  adderal,  they're  not  aloud  to  use  it?
__label__a the  first  time  i  did  xanax  was  probs  the  best  time
__label__a Listened  to  Danny  Brown  all  the  way  home  and  I  really  want  loads  and  loads  of  Adderall  now.
__label__c they  promise  it'll  be  painless.  they  pump  me  full  of  morphine  and  give  anaesthetic.  but  since  i  anyway  need  double  dose  it's  not  enough.
__label__c adderall  had  me  filling  out  the  march  madness  brackets  for  2015

__label__c mix  in  the  depression  medicine  and  the  adderall  for  my  adhd  and  it's  a  wonder  i  can  stay  awake  any  longer  than  20  minutes  a  day.
__label__m congratulations  you  can  now  sleep  without  seroquel  solution  tantum  painkiller
__label__m mighty  morphine  power  rangers  #adddrugstoamovie
__label__c Also  I  need  more  Ativan
__label__m _U  so  where's  that  adderall  you  were  talking  about?  haha
__label__c _U  I  survived  my  op  and  had  shit  loads  of  fentanyl  oxy  and  tramadol.  It  was  fantastic  now  it  has  all  worn  off  and  I  am  awake  and  in  pain  🤘🤘🤘
__label__m how  does  michael  irvin  have  a  job  as  an  nfl  pundit?  i  could  do  a  more  coherent  job  if  i'd  taken  some  tramadol  before  going  on  air
__label__c _U  _U  i  already  take  ibuprofen,  paracetamol,    codeine  and  gabapentin  so  i  already  rattle.  the  pain  comes  back  though  :(
__label__m _U  _U  It  appears  that  AK  is  pushing  for  people  with  OUD  to  be  treated  with  suboxone.  He  seems  to  think  that  almost  everyone  taking  opiates  has  OUD.  He  appears  to  have  a  financial  stake  in  the  drugs  to  treat  OUD  or  addiction.
__label__m Wow,  unbelievable  (but  really  believable)  story  about  the  Suboxone.  They  even  filed  the  citizen’s  petition  essentially  against  themselves  over  the  meltaways  to  halt  the  process  of  generics?  That  is  so  gross  and  wrong.
__label__m Math--Meth,  or  too  much  THC?    CNN  is  promoting  illegal  drugs  on  air.    Either  way,    the  joint  they  are  passing  is  probably  soaked  in  PCP,  Meth,  Heroine,  Morphine,  or  other  damaging  substances.    No  one  really  knows  for  sure.    Russian  roulette  with  drugs  destroys  the  brain---stupid.
__label__m You  use  to  be  somewhat  hard  if  u  had  a  face  tattoo  now  u  just  gotta  have  a  soundcloud  and  pop  pressed  xanax

__label__c _U  so  i  come  from  gang  culture  as  an  Italian  American  in  Queens  NY  and  had  a  VERY  violent  past,  The  Ativan  calmed  me  down  so  much  and  slowed  the  mind  down  enough  to  see  that  wasnt  the  way,  They  are  dying  to  get  me  off  the  Benzos,  odds  are  very  strong  id  end  up
__label__m I  don't  pop  Xanax  because  pills  are  for                                        P  U  S  S  I  E  S
__label__m _U  I  prefer  novicane  and  Xanax.  Did  you  know  they  have  to  have  a  special  license  to  administer  Xanax  with  nitrous  gas?
__label__m _U  I  worked  with  a  girl  on  an  assembly  line  once  whose  eyes  were  always  like  that.  She  did  everything  in  slow  motion  it  seemed,  but  got  her  work  done  quickly  nevertheless.  She  was  extremely  calm.  Too  calm.  I  assumed  she  was  on  Valium  or  something  similar.
__label__c i  had  to  take  a  valium

__label__m PSA:  if  your  homie  is  mixing  Xanax  &  percs  make  sure  they're  awake  if  they're  awake  they're  breathing  sleeping  could  lead  to  resp  failure
__label__c i  fucking  forgot  how  late  adderall  makes  me  stay  awake  till
__label__m the  fact  that  people  use  seroquel  (quetiapine)  recreationally  still  baffles  me.
__label__m _U  _U  It’s  like  giving  up  an  addiction.  We  need  daily  therapy  and  methadone.
__label__m _U  I  was  thinking  of  Valium  and  Dozy  lolol
__label__c Not  fun  at  all,had  anxiety  &panic  for  years,I  take  Ativan,it’s  gotten  better  as  I  age  yrs  ago  I  made  trips  to  emerg  because  I  thought  I  had  heart  problems,slow  controlled  breathing,  meditation,breathing  into  a  paper  bag,music,reassuring  yourself  it  will  pass,these  things  all  help

__label__c _U  Clozaril  has  a  higher  rate  of  diabetes.  Zyprexa  which  is  very  similar  sparked  diabetes  in  me.  Geodon  did  not.

__label__a the  amount  of  red  bull,  coffee,  and  vyvanse  in  my  system  right  now  is  gonna  give  me  a  fucking  heart  attack

__label__c Obv.  Idk  how  effective  bupe  would  be  for  your  pain,  or  in  comparison  to  what  u  have  now.  It  was  definitely  better  than  no  opioid  &  tramadol  etc  for  me  for  migraine  &  back  pain  at  same  dose  for  2  yrs  or  so,  didn’t  help  my  IC  though  so  switched  after  that  came  along
__label__m _U  They  did  an  experiment  where  they  fed  lab  rats  Xanax  and  made  them  watch  '90s  NBC  sitcoms  all  day,  and  eventually  they  started  speaking  the  same  way.
__label__m adderall  +  money  =  2  happy  people

__label__a i  need  adderall  to  get  me  through  this  test.  i'm  so  tired  i'm  going  to  fall  asleep.  usual  coffee  ain't  cutting  it.
__label__m _U  I  wonder  if  xanax  is  in  high  demand  since  the  election?  Ahahaha.  Re:Cory  Cory  Cory.  U  r  so  out  of  control.
__label__m *swallows  a  fist  full  of  Xanax*    Wait  for  it...    Okay  now  you  can  talk.
__label__c do  your  job  xanax
__label__m twitter  ain't  even  that  fucking  serious,  take  a  goddamn  valium  and  fucking  relax  for  a  second
__label__c _U  i  use  morphine  and  tramadol.  heavy  duty  stuff.  but  not  really  helping  haha.  i'll  grab  some  cocodomol  now
__label__a but...  i  have  an  adderall  left..  so  i'll  be  golden!  💥
__label__a _U  Does  this  include  fentanyl?  I  lost  someone  to  heroin  but  only  fentanyl  &  morphine  showed  on  tox  report
__label__c _U  for  some  reason  i  can't  actually  picture  this,  even  though  i've  been  taking  gabapentin  for  2  years
__label__m _U  So  fentanyl  and  oxycodone  in  your  system  is  accidental?    Still  an  unfortunate  loss  in  the  real  music  industry.
__label__c life  would  be  so  much  easier  if  i  just  went  and  filled  my  adderall  prescription
__label__m _U  _U  _U  but...he    was  taking  oxycodone?  or  was  there  more?  i  can't  see  oxycodone  make  you  kill  cats  😐
__label__c Made  it  to  Bern  game.  Morphine  shot  I  needed  to  get  thru  Period  3  has  worn  off  so  I'm  imagining  the  pain  of  NOT  being  _U  tonight  🤕

__label__m If  you  don’t  want  people  to  argue  with  you  on  the  internet,  you  shouldn’t  post  your  opinion  on  controversial  stuff...    Also,  if  you  take  suboxone  you’re  not  clean!  😉
__label__m _U  No  worries  though...  She  is  one  bad  weekend  away  from  overdosing  on  vodka,  Xanax,  and  urine  and  then  she  will  be  a  distant  memory.
__label__a These  Xanax  were  mad  for  us  specially  to  erase  knowledge  and  keep  us.  Stagnant  and    get  it  some  days  it’s  just  too  much  it’s  a  mind  eraser  helps  me  become  numb  unfortunately  but  I  need  to  be  numb  right  now

__label__c turning  is  def  worse  than  turbulence  but  this  is  awful  and  i  cant  take  enough  xanax  to  deal  with  it  because  i  go  straight  to  work  after  this
__label__m _U  Both  amphetamine  and  dextroamphrtamine.  Adderall  or  ritalin  would  be  good.  Got  that?

__label__m that  oxycodone  be  .......  😴😴
__label__c _U  I  can’t  send  help.  I’ve  been  in  that  type  of  pain  on  and  off  for  2  years.  Only  tramadol  helps.  X
__label__c I  slept  at  10pm.  And  I  am  up  because  I  have  been  dealing  with  constant  nightmares.  This  happens  often  when  I  don't  take  xanax  to  sleep.      My  mind  plays  all  the  rape  stories  women  have  told  me.  Sometimes  it  feels  like  i  am  haunted    I  am  just  glad  I  get  to  see  my  therapist  at  10  am
__label__c _U  _U  all  the  love.  i'm  so  hoping  mine  doesn't.  it's  ok  with  pregabalin  (expensive)  but  i'm  more  tired  and  have  tremors
__label__c hahaha  mom  took  my  cough  medicine  away  bc  it  has  oxycodone  in  it  and  i  said  it  tastes  good  hahaha

__label__c wanted  to  go  eat  after  school  tomorrow  but  i  forgot  i  had  to  take  adderall  so  i  won't  be  hungry😪
__label__c just  changed  to  seroquel  slow  release  and  still  awake  at  1.30am!  gonna  take  some  adjustments  then...
__label__m who  doesn't  love  adderall  ?  😍
__label__c ok  if  it  is  from  constant  use,  why  can't  I  get  any  pain  meds  for  my  back  at  a  hospital?  I  have  never  relied  on  pain  meds  and  would  only  take  them  2-3  a  month.  Been  a  pain  sufferer  since  I  was  born,  but  sucked  up  the  pain  until  11  and  prescribed  me  hydrocodone  and  ibuprofen  800.
__label__c i  haven't  eatn  since  last  night  ily  vyvanse
__label__m all  of  these  idiots  taking  xanax  is  giving  our  school  such  a  shitty  reputation.  please  stop.
__label__m if  you  ever  leave  me  baby,  leave  some  morphine  at  my  door  cause  it  would  take  a  whole  lotta  medication,  to  realize  what  we  used  to  have  we  don’t  have  it  anymore
__label__c how  pathetic  is  the  following.  had  an  arm  n  back  injury  for  5mnths  told  to  go  in  work  they  would  look  after  me  even  though  im  on  tramadol
__label__m I  am  angry  today.  W/D  can  cause  extreme  nastiness.1  lyrica  patient  /lost  all  of  her  friends    during  detox!  I  can  be  snarky  anyway.  I  think  SHE  -PM-  should  exp.  some  of  this!  Very  disturbing  that  they  don't  inform  about  W/D.  Of  course  I  am  angry!
__label__c i  might  as  well  go  to  the  library.  fuck  adderall  i  been  up  for  29  hours.  can't  sleep  for  shit
__label__u Lyrica  Anderson  is  slept  on
__label__m _U  valium  only  available  from  dr  here.  will  see  how  it  is  in  the  morning.  _U

__label__c that  tramadol  doesn't  do  anything  for  me  sef.  one  time  i  was  on  tramadol  and  diclofenac  (sp?)  at  the  same  time.  smh
__label__a my  need  for  adderall  is  ridiculous  i'm  literally  assigning  photos  to  contacts  right  now  instead  of  writing  this  paper  god  help  me

__label__c why  is  my  adderall  not  working?  i  took  it  over  an  hour  ago  and  i  still  feel  nothing
__label__m only  in  cabo  do  you  casually  get  offered  weed,  cocaine,  ecstasy  and  adderall  walking  down  the  street  lol
__label__c at  least  my  doctors  are  keeping  me  drugged  up  on  morphine
__label__a 100%  certain  the  only  thing  that  can  save  my  semester  is  a  whole  lotta  adderall  and  sleepless  nights.
__label__m That  is  86-87  tabs/person/year,  a  6  week  supply  at  one  tablet  2x  daily.  There  r  8  2/3  six  week  periods/year.  Divide  the  population  by  8.67  &  that  is  the  maximum  #  of  people  taking  Oxycontin/year.  Since  Oxycontin  pain  relief  usually  lasts  6-8  hour=3-4  tabs/day  ÷  buy  4  for  #  users.
__label__m Can  everybody  please  stop  shooting  into  the  air?    My  poor  dog  needed  a  refill  on  his  Xanax!  This  has  been  going  on  every  night  since  Canada  Day.      Who  knew  the  Canadians  of  Los  Angeles  were  this  enthusiastic  about  their  history?
__label__c I  begged  them  to  take  that  gauze  out  of  my  ear  and  to  give  me  something  to  knock  me  out,  I  hadn't  slept  in  2  days.  They  injected  me  with  something,  I  think  it  was  Morphine.  They  said  wisdom  teeth  caused  it.  When  that  healed  I  had  2  pulled,  &  the  other  2    surgically  removed.
__label__c I'm  going  to  need  5  xanax  tomorrow  hopefully  I'll  be  dead  during  the  procedure
__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine,  Clorox  bleach
__label__c I  have  RA  my  GP  put  me  on  gabapentin  months  ago  &  it’s  not  touching  this  pain  it’s  all  over  my  body  ‘joints’  it’s  unbearable  &  can  not  sleep  I  also  have  crohns  which  is  under  control  does  anyone  have  RA  flares  &  if  so  how  long  does  this  last  Thank  you  .  -  Anita

__label__m Rappers  please  stop  using  Xanax  it’s  not  chill  it’s  not  safe  just  smoke  weed  like  the  old  days
__label__m 300  Tramadol  seems  like  you  are  planning  a  long  holiday!?
__label__c Today  is  my  first  day  taking  klonopin  after  five  months  of  being  off  it  and  I’ve  somehow  emerged  in  the  5th  dimension.

__label__m _U  u  seen  the  xanax  2s?
__label__c they  gave  me  so  many  drugs  ...  the  only  thing  that's  helped  is  dilaudid  and  valium  —  the  strongest  pain  reliever  combination.  i'm  a  trooper.
__label__m _U  that  daily  beast  headline  is  ignorant.  this  guy  is  a  fuckboy  who  had  a  heroin  addiction.  suboxone  is  used  to  ween  people  off
__label__m _U  Ding  Ding  Ding.  Adderall  kicked  in.

__label__a if  anyone  has  an  adderall  connect  they'd  like  to  share  it  would  be  greatly  appreciated  bc  i  don't  wanna  fail  out  of  college
__label__a I  was  having  sex  on  coke  and  xanax  when  I  heard  the  news  peep  died  I  just  started  crying  took  the  rubber  off  and  went  to  go  cry  in  the  car
__label__a i  just  wish  i  fuckin  knew  someone  i  could  buy  adderall  off  😩😩😩😩
__label__u Lyrica  bye  😒  you  in  the  way  of  making  A1  money.  Telling  him,  he  can't  have  no  girls  on  his  labels.  BYE  #lhhhollywood
__label__c packing  to  move  is  much  easier  when  you  have  a  butler  or  packhorse  or  xanax.  xanax  makes  it  easier  to  deal  when  the  other  two  are  imaginary.
__label__c _U  i  have  rls  too.  lyrica  helps  but  only  mildly.  no  doc  can  figure  out  source  of  pain  &  opioids  are  only  thing  to  control  it
__label__m preferably  in  the  oil  dale  region  i  will  give  u  a  bby  nug  of  weed  or  valium  i  just  need  a  stoge  😭😭😭
__label__m It’s  best  not  to  hurt  yr  liver  or  #OD  on  #Tylenol.  You  can  permanently  damage  yr  liver,  &need  a  liver  transplant.  #Morphine  is  relatively  safe,  works  very  well  to  get  rid  of  pain,  yet  the  Feds&  Politicians  don’t  want  us  to  have  it.  #Morphine  has  been  around  since  Romans#WHY?
__label__m have  trouble  focusing?yes?you  suffer  from  add.this  causes  numbness.try  abilify

__label__m active  mind  is  adderall
__label__c hey  everyone  pray  4  me  to  get  xanax  at  the  doctors  today
__label__m _U  i'm  talking  about  these  ppl  that  go  to  the  emergency  room  everyday  and  get  hydrocodone  everyday,  and  they  still  write  for  it
__label__m since  1988,  we've  known  perhaps  20%  of  the  population  probably  don't  get  any  benefit  from  codeine  b/c  they  don't  metabolize  it  to  morphine
__label__c Even  on  oxycodone  my  jaw  is  throbbing
__label__c _U  Now  that  I  think  about  it  this  was  the  week  I  got  my  wisdom  teeth  out  and  was  high  on  hydrocodone  much  of  the  time  and  wrote  daddy  kink  smut  about  Zayn  and  Luke  so  I  truly  wasn't  in  my  right  mind
__label__c so  i  was  discharged  from  the  hospital  yesterday  and  all  i've  been  feeling  is  pain  in  my  leg,  damn  i  need  more  morphine
__label__m _U  are  any  of  these  side  effects  going  off  lyrica  effects?  I  know  it  works  entirely  different  than  cymbalta,  but  spasms  are  a  part  of  cymbalta  detox  and  sometimes  the  drugs  are  prescribed  for  the  same  thing
__label__c really  pissed  that  i  lost  my  seroquel  because  now  i  can't  sleep..cool
__label__m _U  Oh!  Mothafucka!  Hopefully  you  at  least  got  that  morphine  drip  like  I  ordered  you  to  ease  all  the  pain...  sorry,  Cybill...  😤😢
__label__m _U  actually  my  name  would  b  faze  xanax
__label__m _U  Dang  Dano.  I  see  a  morphine  drip  in  your  future
__label__c i  can't  sleep  on  hydrocodone

__label__m Xanax  doesn't  make  you  cool.  Percocet  doesn't  make  you  cool.  Codeine  doesn't  make  you  cool.  They  will  kill  you.

__label__a _U  i  know  plenty  of  folk  on  pregabalin  who  still  drink  (in  moderation).  but  i'd  stay  off  the  booze  in  the  first  few  weeks.
__label__m Atleast  I'm  not  using  Seroquel  analogues  and  suboxone/Fentanyl    (Proven  By  the  UN  day  before  you  raided  Cannibus  Culture)  to  dope  out  woman  and  children.

__label__c Who  ever  created  Xanax  can  rot  in  the  deepest  part  of  hell.  That  drug  is  the  biggest  piece  of  shit.  I  think  there  are  other  ways  to  treat  what  Xanax  is  prescribed  for  (which  is  mainly  Anxiety  &  PTSD).  Don’t  @  me.
__label__c _U  tramadol  did  ZERO  for  me  after  heart  surgery.  when  I  got  home  it  was  like  taking  an  m&m.  tylenol  was  more  effective.
__label__m _U  His  doc  can  keep  him  on  Valium    Or  Meth,  for  all  I  care
__label__c _U  i  need  to  never  touch  xanax  again.  i'm  sure  i  will,  but  i  don't  want  to  lose  another  15  years  of  my  life  to  that  drug.

__label__m _U  Oh  yeah  -  you  have  a  lot  to  take  in  -  do  you  have  Xanax  close  by?  A  kitten  or  puppy  to  hug?  Maybe  some  meditative  music  to  queue  up.  #Resist  depression  #VoteThemOut

We  have  Gabapentin  to  give  her  1hr  before  the  appointment  to  help  chill  her  out;  please  please  please  cross  your  fingers  that  it  works  because  otherwise  it's  going  to  be  hellishly  stressful  even  though  she's  physically  better.

__label__m _U  are  we  sure  or  is  that  the  oxycontin  talking?
__label__m _U  Yes  I  can  state  from  fact  that  the  vets  around  us  no  longer  give  out  the  equivalent  of  Tramadol  to  pets.    Just  had  my  girl  spayed  on  Friday.    When  I  had  my  other  girl  spayed  they  gave  us  the  pain  meds.    It  helped  to  make  them  drowsy  so  they  dont  un  do  stitches.
__label__c The  Ativan  I  took  for  my  original  flight  has  mainly  worn  out  and  the  Ativan  I  took  for  my  new  flight  hasn’t  kicked  in  yet  so  pray  it  kicks  in  very  very  very  soon  bc  we  are  boarding  now.

__label__c just  took  some  tramadol  for  pain.  physically  therapy  helped  but  it  still  hurts.
__label__m _U  NPR  is  quite  literally  the  opposite  of  what  you  do.  They  are  audio  valium.

__label__m _U  is  dominican  xanax  different  than  other  xanax?
__label__m In  2017  Joyce  byers  is  hooked  on  oxycontin
__label__c _U  I  won't  because  I  can't,  don't  worry.    Just  down  and  off  my  level  due  to  unrelenting  bronchitis,  paxil  and  Xanax  withdraw,  being  between  homes,  and  the  existence  of  truscum.
__label__c I'm  shaking  and  my  Ativan  is  in  that  nonsensical  car.  I'll  just  ride  this  out.  It's  way  too  cold  to  go  outside.

__label__m Bupe  will  be  added  to  the  many  promises  of  medicine  that  under-delivers.  In  10  years,  it  will  have  followed  in  the  footsteps  of  methadone.  Life  saver  for  some.  Neutral  for  others.  Harmful  to  some.  It’s  a  wonderful  tool.  A  piece  of  the  puzzle.  Any  other  frame  is  silly.  😊

__label__c I  took  a  look  at  my  life.  Ashamed.  Depressed.  I  thought  about  taking  my  life.

__label__m The  last  part  of  the  notes  could  be  JK  hallucinating  and  seeing  things  because  of  morphine.    But  again,  this  is  a  theory  and  whatever  we've  learnt  from  BigHit  THEORIES  are  90%  of  the  times  wrong
__label__m _U  i  don't  think  that  you  can  say  that.....  i  mean  anabolic  steroids  and  adderall  are  a  little  different.
__label__m The  tramadol  thing  be  serious  issue  like  that?  Just  spent  the  evening  with  some  street  kids  and  most  of  them  are  high  on  it.  One  is  lying  here  unconscious  sef.
__label__u lyrica  garrett  really  worked  with  ike  and  tina  turner,  chaka  kahn  and  stevie  wonder  lol  look  her  up  y'all  😂  #lhhh

__label__u someone  swing  a  matching  lyrica  layout  my  way  thanks
__label__m _U  Whats  next?  Tramadol  turned  me  into  a  tranny!  😂😂
__label__m but,  in  #mh  practice,  what  a  'patient'  reports  may  not  be  accorded  much  status  :    *  there  is  no  evidence  that  olanzapine  causes  weight-gain
__label__m couch  identifying  a  bottle  of  hydrocodone  collected  at  the  scene.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  The  olanzapine  dose  is  quite  high,  i  was  only  on  10mg,  the  Rivotril  as  well  2mg  3  times  a  day  which  brings  to  a  total  of  6mg  in  one  day,  thats  too  much...benzodiazipine  is  very  addictive
__label__u _U  Whew!!!  Good...😙😙😙  'cause  we  don't  have  much  room  here  in  B'more.  Lol!!!  U  and  Lyrica  are  my  😍😍😍  anyway!!!
__label__c _U  It  does!  😭  when  I  got  there  they  injected  my  finger  right  away  &  gave  me  morphine  and  prescribed  me  narco  for  the  pain  😭😩
__label__m Florida  Blue  isn’t  going  to  cover  OxyContin  anymore.  Let’s  see  how  this  goes.
__label__m _U  _U  Tramadol  is  not  good  for  u.STOP  IT
__label__c i  very  desperately  need  valium  or  some  shit  because  klonopin  is  as  effective  as  hitting  me  with  a  toy  hammer
__label__a _U  😂😂😂after  the  valium  and  a  couple  shots  i'll  be  lucky  to  form  words  let  alone  shout😂😂
__label__m pt:  i  slept  so  good  whatever  you  gave  me  worked.  well  you  literally  asked  for  2  norcos  and  a  xanax  😑
__label__m _U  _U  I  recommend  about  75  diazepam  ground  up  in  his  soup.  Or  Lindt  blended  with  Ex-Lax...
__label__c is  life  going  great  or  is  it  just  my  vyvanse  talking  ?  😀
__label__m _U  _U  Methadone  kills,  suboxone  kills,  untreated  opiate  addiction  kills,  kratom  is  a  safe  alternative  to  all  of  these
__label__m _U  _U  oxycodone  that  makes  you  loopy  😂😂
__label__c _U  _U  damn  no  more  hydrocodone  for  me
__label__m _U  have  you  heard  of  all  the  kid  oan  valium  deaths  in  glasgow?
__label__a I  just  woke  up  from  a  2  day  Xanax  comma...lol  I  love  sleeping.
__label__c _U  I  want  to  try  melatonin.  I  take  quetiapin  ,but    side-effects.stoped  taking  Lyrika  450  mlg  daily  .  I  take  an  anti-depressant.  Want  to  stop  with  it  all  and  start  chelation  (    getting  rid  of  mercury  in  the  body  ).  Want  to  do  it  at  home  .
__label__c i  think  the  risperidone  is  working.  i  had  real  human  interaction  at  work  today  with  my  boss  and  we  didn't  kill  each  other.
__label__a Just  give  me  some  adderall,  a  pack  of  smokes,  and  a  room  full  of  people  to  argue  with  about  shit  and  im  content
__label__c _U  im  tapering  off  suboxone  right  now.  your  videos  have  helped  me  so  much.  thank  u,  you're  a  blessing  in  this  world  of  addiction.
__label__m do  u  know  what  meds  r  4  bipolar  depression?  currently  #fda  approve  combination  of  #olanzapine  &  #fluoxetine

__label__m "_U:  adderall  had  me  wondering  why  we  drive  in  parkways  but  park  in  driveways..."  this  got  me  screwed  up.  lmfao
__label__m _U  well  purity  is  in  reference  to  general  authenticity  of  the  substance,  heroin  is  usually  added  to  by  dealers  and  morphine  is  not.
__label__c ❤️  the  _U  pharmtech  treating  me  like  an  addict  for  a  doc  prescribed  hydrocodone  refill.  guess  i  should  just  take  aspirin.  #misscvs
__label__m "We  would  not  have  a  heroin  problem  without  OxyContin."  -_U  #JOUR4530  #opioid
__label__m I  need  to  take  Xanax  before  this  game  #ALLCAPS
__label__m They  have  to  keep  blaming  Rx  opioids  and  confusing  American  citizens  in  order  to  promote  their  agenda  which  is  to  misdiagnose  all  CPP's  as  having  "Rx  opioid  use  disorder"  so  they  can  strip  us  of  our  meds  and  force  us  all  on  to  Suboxone.    This  is  how  they  will  make  billions
__label__m _U  eatin  on  a  adderall
__label__c _U  Yea  bro  they  have  me  hydrocodone.  Just  waiting  for  this  damn  numbness  to  wear  off
__label__c _U  Pre  fusion  all  they  offered  me  was  Lyrica  and  Gabapentin  so  I  forced  to  shelf  medicated  abusing  the  meds  tequila  cannabis.  I  have  had    little  strokes  from  pathetic  Australian  Heath  System.  _U    Lyrica  kills  #population  control  ?
__label__c _U  _U  Finally  saw  the  doc.  He  gave  me  yet  another  script  for  gabapentin  (I  hate  this  drug),  and  said  I  need  an  IV  infusion  to  stop  the  burning  pain  all  over  my  body
__label__m _U  for  us  its  a  VALIUM  the  size  of  a  Volkswagen
__label__a Whoever  slipped  me  Valium,  so  I  would  violate.  You’re  an  asshole.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Nope,  no  Methodone,  no  Opana,  not  trying  to  get  fucked  up!!!  Some  people  have  their  own  constitution  and  if  a  Percocet  works  why  would  you  not  just  take  a  Percocet???
__label__a i  just  took  a  piss  n  i  seen  xanax  comin  out
__label__c physio  and  2  days  in  london  =  pain  -  glad  i've  got  some  tramadol  left!!
__label__m _U  First  of  all...  who  takes  lines  of  adderall
__label__m In  his  interview  with  Mike  Tirico,  Adam  Rippon  name  drops  In-n-Out  and  Xanax.    What  a  guy.  #WinterOlympics
__label__a eat  a  xanax  for  the  pain,  no  one  understands  how  i  hurt
__label__m _U  people  need  to  start  taking  xanax  more  often  in  this  country.  one  pill  in  the  mouth.  another  in  the  ass.
__label__c Should  of  taken  a  xanax  before  the  dentist
__label__m firm  believer  in  bettering  your  own  life.  also  a  firm  believer  is  xanax
__label__m _U  —  sleep  off  the  morphine  and  anesthesia.  Given  he'd  been  operated  on,  again.  His  body  was  exhausted  and  needed  to  heal,  —
__label__c omg  did  i  just  took  valium  by  accident  rip  i  was  good  girl
__label__a look  in  my  face  im  on  adderall
__label__a No  wonder  I  love  adderall  #meth
__label__m Lolol  my  dog  ate  one  of  my  moms  Xanax  😂
__label__m i  remmember  i  feel  asleep  with  my  snake  on  xanax  lmao  he  hid  under  my  bed
__label__c doctor  has  increased  my  prozac  and  given  me  valium      i  actually  prefer  kratom  to  codeine  and  valium
__label__m _U  _U  You  don't  need  Xanax  to  feel  normal.    Know  that.
__label__m #LebronJames  has  #Adderall  eyeball  👁  #Gamethree
__label__m _U  Damn  dude!  I  let  the  man  have  his  morphine
__label__c Going  strong  off  5  hrs  of  sleep  and  Valium.  Not.  So  read  to  crash  into  bed  lol
__label__m _U  _U  Good  to  see  even  more  actual-outcome  based  evidence,  but  fentanyl  has  been  the  better  option  for  some  time.  Viva  la  fentanyl!  And  while  you're  ditching  the  morphine,  toss  the  clopidogrel  un  the  bin,  too.
__label__a i  need  a  big  blue  from  the  store  to  mix  this  hydrocodone  with.
__label__m Yuuuunuug  leaaaan  up  in  the  cluub  for  some  morphine
__label__c morphine  is  pretty  lit  before  brunch  time  #happymardigras  from  my  hospital  bed  #whodat  #geauxtigers  #geauxpokes  #geauxdawgs  #geaux2hellul
__label__m _U  You  spelled  morphine*  wrong
__label__c I  have  that  also  but  I've  also  got  several  discs  that  have  ruptured  from  an  accident  yrs  ago.  I  was  on  morphine  and  hydrocodone  for  15  yrs  and  it  was  damaging  my  insides.  I'm  now  off  the  morphine  and  using  pot  to  help  the  pain.  I'm  actually  doing  a  lot  better  than  I  was  on  meds.
__label__c last  few  days  ive  been  feeling  anxious  i  think  its  because  my  psychiatrist  put  me  on  a  low  dose  of  vyvanse  to  take  every  day
__label__a yes  let's  just  scream  that  you  need  to  buy  adderall  from  your  friend
__label__a time  to  pound  the  adderall
__label__c _U  _U  quetiapine  doses  under  my  consultants  face  like  a  frantic  beast  desperate  for  drugs
__label__c _U  I  used  to  have  the  adderall  patch.  Shit  made  me  crazy.
__label__m _U  i  think  it's  up  to  80mg  for  maintaining  doses.    but  i;m  not  an  expert.    prozac  and  adderall  are  undergrad  stuff  though.
__label__c this  librarian  was  trying  to  get  naughty  behind  a  bookshelf  but  this  vyvanse  has  me  too  focused  on  this  test  i  didn't  study  for  in  6th  grade
__label__m two  men  from  #glasgow  and  a  man  and  woman  from  #elgin  have  been  charged  f'wing  recovery  of  £20,000  worth  of  cannabis  and  valium  in  the  town
__label__c Turns  out  klonopin  makes  me  a  goofy  weirdo  who  can't  remember  shit,  so  that's  fun  to  experience  in  a  group  setting.  Totally  not  one  of  my  greatest  fears  come  to  life
__label__m It's  not  the  past  or  present  admin-it's  .gov  agencies,PROP,pharma  co's  pushing  suboxone,and  political  hacks  like  Kolodny  and  Gottlieb.
__label__m my  mom  deadass  told  me  that  she  believes  I’d  need  a  Xanax  if  I  ever  met  taylor  bc  I’d  be  so  out  of  control  ksjdksndksk  ok  mom
__label__c When  your  xanax  doesn't  even  help  with  your  anxiety  anymore.  Dying  to  feel  normal  again
__label__c thanking  god  for  hydrocodone  b/c  i  was  in  so  much  pain.  now  it's  time  for  me  to  get  out  this  bed  and  go  to  work.  meds  finally  kicked  in.🙌🏾

__label__m _U  _U  people  go  need  panadol  then  tramadol  after  listening
__label__c thank  goth  for  adderall  tho
__label__m _U  Drug  abuse  is  on  the  increase  in  Nigeria.  The  latest  abused  drug  now  is  tramadol.  The  NDLEA  should  be  empowered  to  check  this  trend
__label__m _U  some  morphine  and  maybe  a  glass  of  water  he's  happy  you  stay  a  few  moments  longer.    will  tries  to  move  his  stiff  wrist  to
__label__m like  someone  said,  at  least  it  wasnt  hgh  or  roids,  and  plus  they  previously  cleared  him  to  take  adderall  in  the  past....ho  hum....
__label__a “Thanks  for  the  Valium,  Susan”
__label__m _U  is  that  seroquel
__label__c still  awake.  wondering  if  this  is  an  effect  of  the  vyvanse  😳  #vyvanse  #adhd
__label__m _U  Nicotine,  Heroine  and  Morphine  are  my  soul  sisters
__label__m I  cannot  stand  ppl  who  just  follow  &  praise  celebrities.  Stay  off  the  OxyContin  since  you  all  think  they’re  demi-gods.  They’re    ppl  who’s  shit  stinks  just  as  much  as  yours.  So  get  off  your  knees  to  these  EVIL  self-serving  idiots  &  you  might  learn  a  thing  or  two  about  real  life.
__label__m Sometimes  I  just  sit  in  the  dark  and  wonder  how  much  Tramadol  &  Morphine  Bruce  Wayne  has  to  ingest  after  every  night  out  as  Batman.      I  hope  he’s  not  getting  addicted  too.  I  really  fear  for  his  safety.
__label__m steal  them  bc  they’re  already  addicted.  non  narcotics  like  gabapentin  and  pregablin  are  often  effective  at  treating  pain  management,  combined  w  regular  treatment  from  a  doctor.  i’m  genuinely  sorry  for  the  pain  this  girl  +  others  suffer.  i  don’t  want  anyone  to  have  to  live  with  +
__label__m _U  check  your  email  valium  daze  coming    your  way
__label__c _U  i  took  xanax  for  a  few  months  (just  stopped)  and  lexapro  for  a  month  maybe  i  can  help
__label__a 😮  rt  _U:  snorted  adderall  i'm  so  fadded
__label__a right.  time  for  a  bacardi,  tramadol  &  zopiclone  cocktail.
__label__c adderall  got  me  flyin  through  work  😬
__label__m If  you  take  Xanax  habitually  I'm  sorry  but  you're  a  crackhead  lol.  Losers
__label__a So  the  bad  news  is,  I  hurt  my  foot  at  my  marathon  today.  But  the  good  news  is  I  found  some  expired  OxyContin.
__label__c I  think  withdrawal  made  me  thr*w  up  last  night...  fuck  Effexor  lives  Wellbutrin  is  literally  so  skinny...  going  last  tabs  of  klonopin....  Rest  In  Piece  Bitch‼️‼️
__label__m _U  pretty  sure  we  were  avoiding  homework  on  adderall
__label__c oh  well  at  least  i  got  this  adderall  😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
__label__m dunno  if  i  need  sex  or  adderall  rn
__label__m _U  _U  _U  yep    utah  300,000  fake  vicodin  w  fentanyl  instead  of  hydrocodone    $10  each
__label__m _U  and  mainstream  music  is  filled  with  codeine  references,  bragging  about  xanax,  degrading  lyrics,  over  hot  trap  beats.  pick  your  lane
__label__a i  do  xanax  so  i  can  forget  my  whole  night
__label__m wow  this  nurse  at  my  job  in  the  detroit  news  for  stealing  morphine  🤔i'm  just  wondering  why  she  still  employed  tho

__label__m alprazolam  got  these  white  guys  playing  games  😂😂😂😂
__label__a _U  _U  nah  bro  I  smoke  crack  and  Xanax
__label__a _U  I  can  do  that.    It  will  be  painful  as  I  try  not  to  look  at  them  on  a  daily  basis,  but  see  recap  on  MSNBC  as  they  are  now  starting  to  point  out  lies.  Does  it  count  if  I  have  to  pop  a  xanax  first  to  get  through  them?  Who  am  I  kidding,  it's  been  that  kind  of  17  months.
__label__a got  me  some  more  adderall  😊😊😊  this  about  to  be  a  good  end  of  the  semester

__label__m _U  _U  The  doctor  prescribing  his  medication  needs  looking  into.  A  side  effect  of  taking  Gabapentin  is  a  high  risk  of  suicide.This  man  has  attempted  it  a  few  times.What  makes  it  worse  is  he  takes  50  a  day,  what's  his  doctor  thinking?  That's  usually  a  months  worth.

__label__m _U  Is  the  ulcer  very  bad?  I  av  ulcer  too  but  I  use  it  sometimes.  If  it's  so  bad  then  tramadol  is  better
__label__a i'm  not  add  but  i  am  in  serious  need  of  some  adderall  for  these  9.5  hour  days
__label__m xans  &  adderall  that's  a  contradiction
__label__c took  my  adderall  so  that  means  my  personality  will  be  the  equivalence  of  a  potato  today
__label__a i  am  scared  for  my  life  because  i  think  i  am  about  to  pull  two  all-nighters  in  a  row  no  naps  or  adderall  and  maybe  another  one  tomorrow
__label__c There  are  way  too  many  people  parked  at  the  gym.  So  I've  parked  elsewhere  until  it  clears  out  because  I  left  my  lorazepam  behind  and  I  don't  want  an  anxiety  attack  when  I'm  trying  to  get  swole.  I'm  gonna  be  ripped,  fam.
__label__c I  watched  an  Anime  last  night  and  it  was  extremely  overstimulating  to  my  adderall  starved  brain.  It  made  me  very  uneasy

__label__m dylan  blake  needs  to  take  a  xanax  #openheart
__label__m _U  I  almost  forgot.  The  methadone  clinic  is  not  actually  moving  cities,  but  it  is  moving  from  a  really  poor  neighborhood  in  Richmond,  CA  to  the  border  of  an  unincorporated  community  full  of  evidently  racist  and  classist  NIMBYs.  (Who  make  up  nearly  80%  of  their  patients!)
__label__m _U  pump  adderall  into  my  eyeball
__label__m I  need  a  caffeine  drip  today.  Or  a  morphine  drip.  Whichever.
__label__c come  down  from  vyvanse  is  no  joke.  shit  sucks

[He  huffs  playfully,  tugging  a  little  harder  this  time,  shaking  his  head  as  he  tenderly  shifts  his  body  over  a  little,  thankful  for  the  morphine  that  dulls  the  pain.]      You  aren’t  going  to  hurt  me.  I  promise.  I  know  you  want  to  be  closer  just  as  much  as  I  want  you  +
__label__a I  gotta  plug  on  the  pregnant  bitches  cuz  the  doc  always  prescribe  oxycodone  after  the  baby  due  💯😎
__label__c Due  to  me  putting  my  back  out  on  Friday,  today’s  football  viewing  treats  will  again  consist  of  sitting  bolt  upright  and  munching  down  on  Diazepam  and  Codeine  tablets  and  not  the  24  bottles  of  Budweiser  that  I’d  bought  previously  #bollocks
__label__c _U  _U  I  used  to  do  this!!  Now  I  just  don’t  leave  my  house  much,  take  Valium  and  have  panic  attacks

__label__c thankful  that  nitroglycerin  &  morphine  took  the  chest  pain  away  after  2  days  tho!  I  haven't  slept  in  3  now  and  that's  all  I  wanna  do
__label__c no  one  cares  about  poetry  or  valium  anymore  thats  why  i  have  so  many  unfollows
__label__m _U  _U  _U  to  let  go  and  get  on  something  like  seroquel  or  some  shit  that's  how  i  pay  rent  is  taking  med's  i  try

__label__a Really  don't  see  the  appeal  of  Xanax.  Tried  it  once  mixed  in  a  soda  and  all  it  did  was  make  me  sleep😴  y'all  can  keep  that  pill  popping  shit  away  from  me
__label__m _U  Make  that  2  xanax
__label__m _U  _U  Adderall  is  just  a  smarter  way  of  saying  I'm  taking  small  doses  of  meth
__label__m adderall  admiral  by  danny  brown  goes  so  hard
__label__m god  i  wish  i  could  get  some  xanax  or  somethin  rn  lmao
__label__c Trying  really  hard  not  to  fall  into  the  self-recrimination  I'm  so  very  good  at.  C'mon  brain,  we've  been  through  this.    Gonna  be  a  week  of  relying  on  the  Klonopin,  for  sure.
__label__c _U  dilaudid  didn't  do  anything  for  me  b/c  it's  not  meant  to  touch  nerve  pain,  but  it's  just  synthetic  morphine  (less  nausea)
__label__m I  feel  like  with  enough  Klonopin,  anyone  can  become  a  customer  service  master.
__label__c of  course  because  i  chose  to  take  adderall  today  it's  the  one  time  we  have  a  fridge  full  of  food
__label__m guy  in  my  seminar  is  on  adderall  so  i'm  getting  him  to  help  me  write  my  tok  presentation
__label__c half  way  done  this  asti,  ai  klonopin  pills  20  and  counting.  i  wasnt  ieuropaoia
__label__c _U  I  do  it  to  control  body  inflammation.    I've  had  MS  20  years.  One  reason  u  can't  tell  is  cryotherapy.    And  Adderall.      👍
__label__m going  crazy  with  so  many  requests  for  norco  i've  been  writing.  stop  it!  hydrocodone  apap  is  a  really  long  drug  with  yo  sigs  and  quantities🙄😭
__label__a adderall  in  my  espresso  at  this  point
__label__m they  even  made  a  xanax  emoji  for  you  fools  that  still  do  that  shit  🧟‍♂️
__label__a taking  an  adderall  and  cleaning  my  entire  house  was  so  worth  it
__label__c _U  there  is  always  a  reason.  a  trigger  waiting  to  be  found.  xanax  knocks  me  the  eff  out  so  i  just  try  and  ride  it  out.
__label__c _U  Coming  off  was  horrendous  for  me.  They  had  to  give  me  Valium  when  I  was  coming  off  and  I  was  more  suicidal  than  before  I  started  the  meds.  The  combo  I'm  on  now  works  great.  Sending  lots  of  love.  ❤️❤️❤️
__label__c adderall  makes  me  feel  so  crazy
__label__m #cottontownhall  wants  to  know  if  you  think  insurance  should  cover  morphine  as  an  appropriate  treatment  for  elders  with  dementia,  tom.
__label__m _U  _U  methadone  &  its  dispensing  &  witness  fees  is  much  more  expensive,  and  has  a  lower  safety  profile,  than  suboxone  /4

__label__m _U  _U  Gov't  has  a  role  in  harm  reduction  by  designating  areas  where  addicts  can  use  where  narcan  is  available  as  well  as  clean  syringes  etc.  For  those  ready  to  quit  we  need  to  make  MAT  readily  available  by  empowering  more  doctors  to  dispense  suboxone  &  Vivitrol  .

__label__a after  u  pop  that  first  adderall  and  study,  it's  almost  impossible  to  study  w/out  it  ever  again
__label__a beer  before  liquor,  never  sicker.  oxycodone  before  liquor,  get  in  a  shoving  match  with  a  bathroom  towel  dispenser.
__label__a _U  funny  bc  when  i  told  u  that  you  had  a  problem  with  adderall  when  we  went  to  the  caves  u  laughed  it  off  and  changed  the  subject
__label__c In  the  old  days  they  used  drugs  to  inspire  stories.  When  I  have  to  take  morphine  for  pain  I  just  giggle  and  sing.  No  fair.

__label__c _U  Honestly  sometimes  I  just  look  at  my  bottle  of  Xanax  and  I  feel  better  it  feels  good  knowing  you  have  something  that  will  help  with  your  anxiety  sometimes  it  makes  me  feel  like  *in  control*  and  like  I’m  bigger  than  my  anxiety.  And  I  don’t  even  have  to  take  a  pill.
__label__a i  can  never  remember  if  i  took  my  adderall  already  or  not...  and  then  it's  like,  only  one  way  to  find  out!!!  and  then  i'm  up  all  night...

__label__a being  tired,  hungry,  and  on  a  lot  of  adderall  is  the  weirdest  experience  ever  and  it  happens  4  out  5  days  of  the  week  for  me.
__label__a _U  fuck  you,  i  need  the  money  to  sustain  my  adderall  addiction
__label__a wonder  what  is  more  #weakandwobbly  me  after  8  pints  and  50mg  of  morphine  or  #weakandwobblymay?
__label__m _U  No  kidding  ,  they  even  seemed  to  favor  MS  13  murderous  thugs  over  Americans  !!!!  Those  people  are  NUTS  .....  Nancy  Pelosi  is  a  hateful  evil  witch  who  was  chewing  her  lip  off  last  night  ....  Valium  addict

__label__m envious  of  people  who  can  take  5mgs  of  valium  and  have  it  actually  work
__label__a would  rate  coffee  and  ativan  10/10
__label__m people  constantly  saying  they  can't  sleep  -  it's  an  easy  fix,  fix  yourself  a  stiff  drink  or  dose  up  on  valium  -  problem  solved
__label__m _U  This  is  a  great  read.  I  do  believe  the  primal  brain  is  more  powerful  than  our  intellectual  brain  -  it  evolved  first  and  allowed  humans  to  stay  alive.  I  think  addiction  is  a  primal  brain  function  and  can  be  attenuated  by  methadone,  etc.  Moral  judgments  will  never  be  effective.

__label__m When  u  consider  pressed  xans  maybe  specifying  whether  they're  medical  grade  xanax  makes  sense
__label__c In  2  years  I  have  been  prescribed:  Citalopram  Fluoxetine  Priadel  Duloxetine  Diazepam  Venlafaxine  and  Melatonin  for  my  mental  health.  Wonder  when  my  psychiatrist  will  realise  that  coming  off  and  going  onto  new  medications  constantly  might  be  adding  to,  not  reducing  my  problems.
__label__c _U  had  a  morphine  epidural  attached  to  my  spine,  could  not  feel  my  chest  for  weeks  but  was  as  high  as  a  butterfly.  b)
__label__m when  people  who  don't  have  adhd  take  adderall  and  then  ask  me  "is  this  what  you  feel  like  all  the  time,"  i  honestly  dont  know  how  to  respond
__label__c tonight  i  shall  mostly  be  taking  tramadol  and  sleeping  #sciatica

__label__m _U  _U  _U  no  doubt  they  probably  prescribe  pregabalin  and  think  it's  the  treatment  for  all  pain  syndromes
__label__m _U  As  long  as  Marijuana  remains  a  Schedule  I  drug  alongside  Heroin  &  LSD,  and  Oxycodone  remains  a  Schedule  II  drug,  it's  impossible  to  trust  you  all  about  anything  drug  related.
__label__c I’ve  got  so  much  muscle  Tension  lately.  Seeing  my  Pain  doc  today  but  I’ve  been  taking  entirely  too  much  Valium  (for  muscle  spasms  not  anxiety)  and  I  hope  I  don’t  have  rebound  anxiety  when  I  switch  to  another  muscle  relaxer.
__label__a first  day  of  school  vibes:  started  crying  bc  adderall  is  wearing  off,  still  hungover  &  its  8:34,  exactly  34  mins  past  my  bedtime😅😭😭

__label__c _U  Whatever  you  do  ,  if  you  are  not  used  to  tramadol,  stay  off  the  net.  First  time  I  was  on  tramadol  a  vaguely  remember  looking  for  a  hat  for  a  wedding  I  was  going  to.  Over  the  next  ten  days  SEVENTEEN  hats  arrived  at  my  home............ooops!
__label__c _U  gone  off  all  of  those  before.  i  was  sick  for  weeks  from  lyrica.  no  problem  w/savella  tho.  i'm  on  a  really  low  dose  of  neurontin
__label__c last  straw  7  yrs  ago  in  south  when  da  professionals  said  had  to  be  on  methadone  for  1  yr,  than  wean  ya  off  a  1  yr  fuck  that  shit  mass  dose

__label__a Took  so  many  Xanax  I  forgot  where  the  Twitter  app  was

__label__m Quran  I  believe  is  to  be  read  in  chronological  order  whereby  what  is  written  before  is  superseded  by  what  is  written  later.  Whatever  beardy  weirdy  said  last  on  a  subject  is  the  word  of  god.  Imagine  if  at  time  of  death  he’d  been  strung  out  on  morphine  hallucinating  about  kittens.
__label__m _U  I  would  get  the  over  the  counter  medication  Dramamine  but  if  Benadryl  knocks  you  out  take  that.  I  honestly  WOULD  NOT  take  oxycodone  cuz  that  drug  if  you’ve  never  taken  it  before  it  could  make  you  feel  super  funny  and  just  more  uncomfortable  on  your  way  down
__label__a _U  2  Valium  &  2  whiskey  and  boom  I  could  be  In  Egypt  but  nah  am  happy  with  Spain  x  😍

__label__c that  awkward  moment  when  you  take  an  adderall  at  the  perfect  time  so  that  you  can  sleep  later  but  it's  been  stuck  in  your  throat  for  4  hours
__label__c _U  _U  It’s  absolutely  dreadful  stuff  I’ve  got  oramorph  as  a  back  up  to  the  slow  release  morphine
__label__m i  think  i  have  really  bad  anxiety  and  need  xanax
__label__c I  would  love  to  know  at  what  point  doctors  will  decide  that  I  can  have  actual  pain  relief.  I’ve  already  had  ten  years  of  being  told  I’m  “too  young”  for  anything  more  than  tramadol.  I’m  not  sure  why  being  young  means  I  have  to  live  in  extreme  pain  rather  than  having  pain  relief  ..
__label__m Have  you  eaten  today?You  probably  have  OCD.This  causes  inability  to  function.Try  Methadone
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  Yeah  all  these  years  of  "I'll  just  deal"  which  was  endless  Percs,  gabapentin,  Torodol,  Rx.  Motrin,  Lestida,  birth  control  finally  caught  up.  You  forgot  what  "normal"  feels  like  and  say  "damn  I'm  horrible  with  my  cardio  training  these  days"  to  yourself.
__label__a xanax  nights  are  the  funniest  nights

__label__a i  would  kill  for  sushi  and  xanax  right  now  and  yes  i  do  know  how  cliche  that  sounds
__label__m _U  It's  as  addictive  as  heroin.  Some  will  take  the  methadone  in  addition  to  the  opiods.

__label__a this  foo  is  boolin  on  the  morphine  heavy  lmao
__label__a Out  of  thc  Dump  caffeine  and  hydrate    Add  gabapentin  and  effexor    Walk  and  flush
__label__m _U  Well  they  do  &  they  don't,    iam  refusing  morphine  full  time,  stupid  I  know  but  need  to  be  me.
__label__a I  am  going  to  go  watch  tv  and  take  a  Xanax--I  don't  take  many--I  just  save  them  for  special  days--Today  is  a  special  day.
__label__c Bruh  this  oxycodone  makes  me  dumb  as  hell.  I  have  trouble  carrying  on  conversations.  My  doc  only  prescribed  me  a  small  dose  too.  How  did  I  know  dudes  in  college  that  popped  this  like  candy,  double  my  dose,  and  then  went  and  drank  and  partied?  I  can  barely  walk  around  my  house
__label__m lavender,  valor,  patchouli,  vetiver,  and  carrier  oil  mixed  together  are  like  liquid  xanax  to  be  really  honest
__label__c _U  Questions    Need  to  be  ask    why  she  got  tramadol  &    is  the  name  on  the  tramadol  box  her  or  her  boyfriend  .I  on  tramadol    my  shelf    and  It  need  to  be  sigh  for  .and  she  much  have  save  them  up.
__label__c Morphine  is  wonderful  Holy  shit
__label__m _U  Kellen  watches  documentary  about  adderall  on  Netflix
__label__c I  see  a  lot  of  comments  on  my  ADHD  lately  and  I  feel  really  shitty  :(.  I  don't  know  what  to  do.  I  quit  taking  adderall  completely  on  December  1st.  I  am  prescribed.
__label__m funny  that  dawn  richard's  adderall  played  right  as  i  read  and  posted  about  ferris  bueller  #ironic
__label__m My  toddlers  could  of  asked  for  methadone  tonight  and  I’d  of  said  yes,  rather  than  upset  the  peace.  Being  a  parent  is  graft.    #dadlife
__label__m You  takin  morphine  baby  you  a  moron
__label__m _U  so  then  you  will  be  writing  about  prescribed  and  monitored  methadone  use,  and  how  shit  and  under  equipped  these  facilities  are?
__label__c i  swear  morphine  is  fucking  me  up
__label__a lol  elizabeth  and  i  took  60mgs  of  adderall  in  the  last  9  hours.  ooookay.
__label__m adderall  fucking  makes  you  gay  i  swear  to  god,  it's  the  reason  there  are  all  these  trans  12  year  olds
__label__m patient  taking  ativan  for  anxiety  should  avoid  herbal  remedies  like  valerian  and  kava-kava  #nursing  #nursingschool  #nclex
__label__m _U  _U  _U  heee  heee  -  thanks  anyway...  night  buddy......  'phew'  u  can  be  better  than  valium  -  i'm  out  of  energy...
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  They  don't  use  a  lot  of  hashtags  except  around  conferences,  legislation,  etc.  But  there  is  #methadone  #buprenorphine  #naltrexone  #addiction    -  and  of  course  the  organizations  themselves.  Bear  in  mind  that  most  SUDs  are  alcohol.
__label__m Straight  white  guys  dye  their  hair  an  ugly  color  get  a  face  tattoo  and  will  put  “lil”  in  front  of  any  random  word  and  then  claim  to  be  a  rapper  when  all  they  ever  rap  about  is  money  they  never  had  and  Xanax  they  probably  got  prescribed  or  just  stole  from  their  depressed  grandma
__label__c nothing  like  a  nice  new  filled  prescription  of  vyvanse  to  kick  off  the  new  school  year
__label__c _U  i'll  help  explain  too  but  i  got  to  go  pick  up  my  oxycontin  &  valium  for  my  leg  which  got  shot  when  i  was  robbed  at  the  liquor  store.
__label__m the  people  vs  xanax
__label__m xanax  are  fucking  retarded  and  childish  pick  urself  up  a  roxy  lil  nigga  #gloup
__label__m If  U  ever  leave  me👶  Leave  some  morphine  at  my🚪  Cause  it  would  take  a  whole  lot  of  💊  To  realize  what  we  used  to  have  We  don't  have  it  anymore
__label__m _U  "You  came  for  me  babe,  That  means  alot  to  me."  More  than  he'll  ever  know.  Roxy  is  fully  ready  to  settle  down  but  he  still  isn't  there.      She  looked  up  at  him  "You  told  me  so  about  what?"  She  had  literally  no  idea  what  he  was  on  about  but  then  again  she  was  on  morphine-
__label__c Then  my  sleep  went  and  I  asked  her  to  increase  my  morphine  she  said  she  can't  because  it's  the  highest  and  she  would  have  to  ask  if  it's  that  bad  I  said  it's  fine  the  pains  gone  now
__label__c fell  asleep  right  after  taking  my  vyvanse  so  i  woke  up  with  a  pencil  in  my  hand  ready  to  get  with  it
__label__a Adderall  so  we  can  go  all  night  long  🔥
__label__m If  Newstart  is  heroin  does  that  make  cashless  welfare  methadone?  -  Critics  of  income  support  often  liken  it  to  an  addictive  drug  ...
__label__c _U  up  &  down  at  the  mo,back  to  docs  over  gallstones,he's  upped  painkillers  to  morphine  as  i've  had  3  painful  'dos'  over  r  days.
__label__c _U  No,  I  don't  know  that  much  about  it  either,  but  glad  it  worked  for  you!  I  had  morphine  a  couple  of  times,  but  to  be  frank  I'm  so  used  to  the  strong  cocodamol  that  it  did  bugger  all,  which  I  was  really  disappointed  about!!  😂
__label__m like  morphine  is  way  worst  and  more  highly  addictive  than  weed  like....  what  yall  doing
__label__c oxycodone  makin'  me  feel  like  i'm  floating  on  clouds  &  ready  to  dance  even  through  the  pain.  🦄☁️
__label__m _U  Tramadol  is  killing  are  people  .....
__label__c i  swear  whenever  i'm  on  vyvanse  i  have  the  most  intricate  and  brilliant  ideas,  none  of  which  pertain  to  the  work  that  i  am  trying  to  finish
__label__m _U’s  sentient  bag  of  pills  has  higher  standards  than  our  #POTUS.  Thanks  Xanax  et  al  for  not  being  a  racist,  incompetent  pile  of  puke.
__label__m it's  annoys  me  when  people  use  adderall  for  something  that's  is  not  supposed  to  be  used  for
__label__c _U  dude  that's  how  i  get  with  adderall  when  i  take  it  for  school.
__label__c _U  I'm  currently  taking  neurontin  for  anxiety  and  it's  amplifying  several  EPS  oddly  enough
__label__m _U  Tramadol  and  Valium?
__label__c _U  this  is  why  i  am  asking  you  for  help  i  have  Parkinson's  disease  from  the  methadone  i  need  to  get  clean  off  everything  or  I  will  die
__label__m _U  Tramadol  is  not  helping  your  #dadjoke  abilities.
__label__a Lol  my  mom  fave  me  tramadol  so  now  I'm  high  as  balls.
__label__m I  also  hope  my  sister  is  issued  a  heap  of  ativan.
__label__m _U  Few  side  effects  with  clonazepam?  Tell  that  to  people  trying  to  withdraw  it!
__label__m Everybody  quitting  Xanax  cold  turkey  this  deep  just  stupid  Withdrawals  gonna  kill  you  doing  that
__label__m LYRICA  TRASH
__label__c Man  I  never  felt  this  calm  since  the  first  time  I  tried  hydrocodone.
__label__a more  like  does  anyone  wanna  give  me  some  adderall  cause  i  don't  fuck  with  doctors  n  shit...
__label__c OMG  the  surgeon  and  nurse  just  removed  my  vac  dressing.  They  put  anaesthetic  on  it  and  gave  me  liquid  morphine  and  I  still  screamed.  It's  been  off  15  minutes  &  still  agony.
__label__c _U  i  think  i  just  threw  up  are  you  kidding  me  biggest  cliffhanger  in  the  history  of  tv  i  had  to  take  a  valium  last  20  minutes
__label__c take  this  shower  take  this  suboxone  good  thing  i  got  this  suboxone  when  times  like  this  happen  and  these  cocksucka's  inside  this  house
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  OxyContin  isn’t  proven  to  be  anymore  addictive  than  any  other  opioid.  Addiction  lies  w/a  predisposed  gene  +  socioeconomic  influences.  Purdue  did  oversell  the  “non-addictive”  thing  though  &  were  fined  around  $600M.  Their  “abuse-deterrent”  was  also  an  issue.
__label__a Fml  I  was  extra  stressed  this  month  and  I  finished  my  ativan  already  but  it’s  like  a  2  entire  weeks  before  I  can  get  my  refill.  So  I’ll  be  a  walking  ball  of  nervous  energy  till  the  end  of  the  month.  🙂
__label__a gonna  tell  my  docter  i  have  depression  so  i  can  get  xanax
__label__a my  roommate  unknowingly  threw  away  my  adderall      any  parties
__label__m Want  some  Xanax?  Hit  up  your  local  gas  station  like  wtf???
__label__a i  was  gonna  workout  today....but  i  took  an  adderall  instead  🙂
__label__a Lmao  i  had  a  xanax  problem  for  like  a  week
__label__m Just  watched  #Mother  and  I  need  a  fucking  lorazepam😠.  #GetTheFuckOut
__label__a adderall  &  mtn  dew  don't  fail  me  now  #nightshiftproblems  _U
__label__m kidding,  tramadol  is  🤙🏼
__label__a in  honor  of  study  week...  dump  your  old  adderall  connect  and  choose  me😃  enough  said,  call  eden
__label__c adderall  had  me  scrubbing  my  bedroom  door  all  night
__label__c _U  Thank  you😭  I  look  like  a  chipmunk,  my  face  is  hot,  the  hydrocodone  isn’t  working,  and  I’m  in  tears
__label__c _U  _U  I  also  have  a  morphine  allergy.  The  only  doctor  who  took  me  seriously  was  an  Indian  woman,  whose  daughter  has  same  allergy.
__label__m Hydrocodone  disclaimer.  I  believe  S10  may  have  also  had  an  ep  that  pushes  the  top  2/3.    What  DOESNT  have  any  challenge,  anywhere,  is  Scooby.  I  believe  S10  may  have  1  ep  that  rivaled  12x12  and  S9  may  have  1  ep  that  rivaled  13x6  alongside  1x13.  Would  have  to  dig.  All  would  be  top  5
__label__m music  stops  the  pain  that's  lyrical  morphine
__label__c It  sucks  when  your  Xanax  doesn’t  do  shit  and  you’re  left  with  feeling  trapped  and  lost  and  in  a  whole  other  world  of  self  hate.
__label__a who  ever  thought  senior  year  would  be  full  of  depressing  nights  being  solved  with  xanax  and  sailor  jerry
__label__a going  ham  on  editing  this  paper,  thank  god  for  adderall
__label__c The  Dr.  mentioned  depakote  as  a  possibility,  but  deferred  to  Seroquel.  Honestly  1  of  the  side  effects  has  been  no  bathroom  trips.  &  finally  today  I  spent  some  time  in  my  bathroom.  Probably  didn't  need  to  know  that  but  it's  the  truth.  Hope  your  follow-up  appt  goes  well  on  Monday!
__label__a A  solid  6.5  hours  in  the  library,  that  I  had  planned  to  use  to  get  homework  for  all  my  classes  done,  was  instead  spent  doing  a  reading  and  two  responses  for  a  class  that  isn’t  even  in  my  major.  SIX  AND  A  HALF  HOURS  ON  ADDERALL,  TWO  ASSIGNMENTS  TO  SHOW  FOR  IT.  What  is  life.
__label__c Y'all  are  coming  on  this  mental  health  journey  with  me  whether  you  want  to  or  not.  I'm  constantly  fighting  to  normalize  talking  about  mental  health,  so  I'm  not  hiding  this  at  all.  Today  was  Day  1  on  Pristiq  +  Ativan  as  needed  for  anxiety  after  2  years  off  meds.  Let's  do  this.
__label__c _U  I  take  a  xanax  but  we  all  have  different  vices  🤷🏻‍♀️
__label__c MORPHINE  IS  AMAZING.  I  was  still  in  a  shit  ton  of  pain.  But  I  was  kinda  cool  with  it  if  that  makes  sense.
__label__c _U  I  take  seroquel.  It’s  an  antipsychotic  lol  it  would  put  down  a  sumo  wrestler
__label__a tramadol  is  a  gift  from  the  gods
__label__c when  i'm  not  on  vyvanse  people  are  stingy  as  fuck  with  their  food,  but  when  i  am  on  vyvanse  everyone  offers  me  food.  like  wtf
__label__m lmaooo  omfg  fuck  xanax  and  fml
__label__m Ah,  the  Doctors  have  to  use  sugar  pills  as  a  placebo  because  they  don't  have  morphine  or  pain  medication.      Now  I  know  exactly  the  episode,  though  the  A-2(?)  and  B  plots  weren't  great
__label__m _U  Naw  but  a  Xanax  or  an  ambien  does  the  trick
__label__m i  am  starting  to  think  some  of  you  people  eat  xanax  and  perc's  for  breakfast  and  wash  it  down  with  booze...
__label__m A  little  Xanax  at  the  half  and  _U  is  back!
__label__m Essilam  (anti-inflammatory)  Used  recreationally  as  a  diuretic  Contraindicated  by  Risperdal
__label__m Listening  to  throwback  3oh!3  while  writing  makes  me  feel  like  I’m  on  Adderall  I  highly  recommend
__label__c They  gave  me  morphine  and  it  didn't  help  my  side  at  all  so  they  gave  me  something  even  stronger  and  now  I'm  so  tired
__label__a adderall  literally  had  me  focusing  on  what  i  want  my  insta  bio  to  be  for  a  good  30  mins  😅😅😅
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Meth  is  dirty  stuff.  Adderall,  maybe...  but  meth,  bad  times.
__label__m people  dying  from  those  xanax  pills  smh  ..
__label__c being  prescribed  adderall  is  great  except  for  the  crash
__label__a fuck  this  shit,  i'm  hitting  the  emergency  diazepam  stash.
__label__c _U  Oh  god  DAMN  it.    I  take  pregabalin  (Lyrica)  and  so  far  there  are  annoying  restrictions  from  it  being  moved  up  a  Federal  category,  but  not  the  @#$@#$@#  hardcopy  prescription  bullshit.    Heartfelt  sympathy.
__label__a first  day  of  class  and  i  don't  have  any  adderall  hahhaah  ha  hahaha  haha  ha
__label__m _U  _U  2mg  sc  morphine  is  that  a  joke  ?

__label__c i  stopped  using  prescribed  oxycontin  following  a  knee  injury  whilst  i  was  a  cop.  now  i  use  cannabis.  i've  never  felt  better.  #4corners
__label__m _U  Will  you  question  Big  Pharma  and  the  role  they  play  in  this  epidemic?  Specifically  the  makers  of  Suboxone  and  Subutex.  How  they  have  swapped  one  drug  for  another.
__label__m _U  _U  Watch  _U  to  keep  the  Will  Arnett  alcoholic  train  going  or  watch  _U  ,  it's  BoJack  methadone.
__label__a never  taking  adderall  unless  i  have  an  exam  the  next  day
__label__m Molly  xan  lean  oxycottin  *  came  from  haiti

__label__m _U  So  what  happens  then?  Honestly  asking...Keep  hearing  the  term,  not  entirely  sure  what  it  means  beyond  increasing  Xanax  sales?
__label__m you  know  what  have  fun  addicted  to  adderall  and  xanax  you  fuckin  tweaker.  youre  not  my  fuckin  problem  anymore
__label__a I'm  glad  I  ain't  the  2015-16  me    I  looked  dead  off  the  Xanax    🙏🏻

__label__m _U  _U  they  used  to  be,  before  criminalization.    you  could  go  to  the  local  druggist,  buy  morphine  and  cocaine  otc.
__label__m _U  _U  are  you  familiar  with  anyone  whose  life,  whose  family,  has  been  destroyed  by  an  oxycontin  addiction?    i  do.
__label__c i  need  to  know  if  the  quetiapine  is  going  to  be  increased  before  i  go  on  holiday  and  they  did  say  they  would  get  back  to  me  today.
__label__a so  i  just  got  home  and  emptied  my  pockets  from  last  night  and  somehow  i  have  3  half  smoked  cigarettes  and  a  valium  😐😐😐
__label__m _U  _U  _U  They  said  he  overdosed  and  even  if  the  xans  were  fake  why  would  you  knowingly  take  a  fake  Xanax

__label__m _U  yeah  thats  my  major  concern,  morphine  can  be  a  tricky  one,  tramadol  is  easy  as  the  countries  hooked  on  it
__label__m _U  2)  sign  1000  forms,  forced  to  get    Narcan(bc  20mg  of  morphine  may  kill  you)  &  then  be  told  u  don't  look  sick,  you're  too  young  to  be  this  sick,  too  young  for  all  this  medicine,  let's  reduce  ur  meds.  At  what  point  do  we  become  aggressive?    We  stay  passive  out  of  FEAR  FROM  YOU!
__label__c _U  _U  _U  I'm  thinking  Seroquel  or  Zyprexa,  with  cotton  mouth  of  course

__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  thanks  mom  just  took  a  hydrocodone  pill  back  pain
__label__m _U  no  morphine  for  when  the  back  hurts?  no  benzos  for  the  times  you're  really  anxious?  no  nothing?
__label__m _U  _U  yeah  who  cares  that's  what  xanax  is  for
__label__c adderall  had  me  starting  a  therapy  sesh  in  class
__label__m i  need  a  digoxin  followed  by  an  amiodarone  followed  by  a  xanax
__label__m #BBNaija  When  Nina  is  out,  def  her  fans  will  vote  Miracle.  So  cc  fans  will  need  some  morphine  cause  they  are  going  to  need  it
__label__c _U  i  had  oxycontin  and  dilaudid  so  i  barely  knew  it  was  there.  when  i  had  visitors  i'd  pick  up  my  pee  bag  and  twirl  it
__label__m LIKE  NEE  NAWS  WONT  GET  THERE  QUICK  ENOUGH  AND  WILL  HAVE  TROUBLE  GETTING  THERE  TOO  TO  GIVE  ME  KETAMINE  NEVERMIND  MORPHINE  FOR  THAT  PAIN
__label__c lyrica  needs  to  get  out  of  my  brain,  i  am  so  incredibly  dizzy  all  the  time
__label__a overdosing  on  adderall  before  a  melee  friendly
__label__a adderall  +  coffee  makes  the  world  go  round  :-)
__label__a Adderall  makes  studying  the  funnest  thing  on  the  planet
__label__c idk  why  me  and  everyone  in  my  family  has  to  have  such  crippling  anxiety  this  is  so  wack  where's  my  ativan
__label__u feenin  x  lyrica  ft  kevin  gates  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  yall  need  to  listen  🙌🙌😩😭
__label__a my  doctor  wanting  to  know  why  i  would  need  more  tramadol.  the  question  should  really  be  how  much  tramadol  can  i  take  to  be  completely  numb.
__label__a where  them  xanax  at  tho
__label__m xanax  is  evil.
__label__c _U  Ask  about  Rexulti.  It  helped  my  anxiety  so  much  also,  Gabapentin  and  Buspar  help.  I  take  my  meds  in  the  morning  but  only  because  I  forget  at  night.

__label__m Never  mind  about  the  methadone  zonked  dog  turd  who  killed  that  family  ,fuck  him  he's  dead.  I'm  more  interested  in  the  fuckwit  who  gave  him  back  his  licence  puttng  his  hand  up  .  His  resignation  and  an  apology  on  the  front  pages  would  be  nice
__label__c _U  yes  it  does  terribly.  i've  taken  a  hydrocodone  earier  but  it  hasnt  helped  it  whatsoever  either  😔
__label__m #causes  of  tooth  decay  in  adults  withdrawal  symptoms  of  hydrocodone
__label__c what  do  you  mean  hydrocodone  will  affect  my  driving  ability?
__label__u _U  :  *names  a  snake  Morphine*    Other  ppl:  You’re  promoting  drug  abuse
__label__a doubled  up  on  my  adderall  oops  💁
__label__m malik:  so  when  you're  depressed  -  would  you  need  a  prozac  or  a  xanax?  |  me:  i  need  a  vacation.
__label__m when  you  hear  that  your  mother  somersaulted  backwards  out  of  her  wheelchair  on  a  slope  &  you  speak  to  her  whilst  she  is  high  on  morphine  😔

__label__m _U  _U  _U  lol  somebody  better  give  his  ass  a  xanax  to  calm  him  down  !
__label__m black  girls  pop  adderall  like  it's  a  turn  up  type  of  drug  or  something  😂😂  girl  it's  not  xanax  or  ecstasy  calm  down  lmao
__label__m _U  It's  made  no  difference  to  the  supply  of  Tramadol  or  Zopiclone  when  they  had  "tighter"  CD  regs  enforced.  We  still  give  them  out  by  the  barrowload  and  people  still  ask  for  emergency  supplies  and  phone/fax  supplies.
__label__m _U  _U  #Neurontin  does  not  kill  pain.  Or  even  slap  it.

__label__a i'm  super  high  on  valium  and  talking  to  beautiful  &  awesome  trans  women.  you  told  college  me  this  would  be  his  life  he'd  say  something  awful

__label__a Stop  glorifying  pain  killers  and  xanax  to  the  youth!  Btw  anybody  got  adderall  (asking  for  a  friend)
__label__m "i  mean,  i  dedicated  my  book  to  klonopin.  that  wasn't  a  joke."
__label__c 4  mgs  of  xanax  does  nothing  for  me..
__label__m _U  there's  no  methadone  in  it  irsay
__label__m have  to  go  to  a  chemist  for  their  daily  Methadone  &  they  all  say  they  have  to  wait  11  weeks  to  get  payment,  so  I  say  what  about  your  food  &

__label__c the  face  masks  don't  work  like  Klonopin  does
__label__m Xanax  are  not  cool.  It  doesn’t  make  you  “hip”.  Unless  you’re  prescribed  them..  It  makes  you  a  drug  addict.  Realize  this  before  it  kills  you.

__label__m _U  they've  got  my  dad  on...  Lyrica?  Cymbalta?  one  of  those  designed  to  chill  your  signaling  system,  originally  for  MS  I  think.  it's  done  wonders  for  him.  he  has  great  insurance,  unlike  myself,  so  he  can  afford  it.  know  I'm  thinking  of  you  today,  cuz  I  know  how  it  feels  😥
__label__c i  just  got  adderall  in  the  mail  with  a  bag  of  m&ms,  valentine's  has  never  felt  so  right

__label__m _U  That  Xanax  Make  U  Trip,  I  Still  ain't  Got  No  Whip,  I  Still  ain't  Got  No  Friends,  At  Least  I  Got  My  Family,  Bullshit
__label__m im  sorry  but  canceling  plans  at  last  minute  is  more  relieving  than  morphine

__label__c _U  Thanks  ...  I  hurt  my  back  so  am  laid  up  in  bed  tripping  on  morphine  and  diazepam  ...  there’s  worst  ways  to  spend  a  Friday  💊💊
__label__m today  in  class  my  teacher  asked  what  can  someone  take  to  stay  awake  and  i  was  confident  af  and  said  adderall  and  everyone  laughed  at  me  :(
__label__m _U  y'all  should  get  adderall  to  sponsor  you
__label__m The  fact  that  I  only  slept  2  hours  total  in  the  past  like  30  hours  and  I'm  not  tired  is  just  pathetic  at  this  point.  And  my  mom  be  like,  "Just  go  to  sleep.  You're  just  not  trying  hard  enough."  I  need  some  fucking  morphine.
__label__c Is  it  a  long  and  uncomfortable  #journey  to  get  off  of  #Suboxone  ??  #JustForToday  #AddictionIsADisease  #roadtorecovery  #addictionsucks
__label__c OMFG.    The  JRT  is  killing  me.    I  had  3hrs  sleep  &  she  screams  you  awake  like  a  dying  rabbit  every  morning  at  6.45.    She  is  very  demanding.    5  more  days  of  it.  I've  never  known  a  dog  like  it.    I  never  sleep  well  because  of  the  pain.    But  I  had  morphine  and  promethazine.
__label__m _U  wouldn't  quite  cut  it.  need  some  morphine  in  my  life  😂
__label__m _U  You  took  ketamine  for  a  dislocation?!😂  I’m  assuming  you  also  take  morphine  for  a  slight  headache....  I  smell  bullshit.
__label__m my  dad  just  texted  me  and  said  i  need  a  adderall
__label__a that  good  good  (seroquel)  is  knocking  me  the  fuck  out
__label__u lyrica  look  diff  from  ig.
__label__m tim  told  me  i  did  a  really  good  job  explaining  the  difference  between  meloxicam  and  tramadol  so  it's  been  a  good  day  ❤️
__label__m lil  peep’s  dumbass  died  due  to  an  overdose  of  fake  xanax  that  turned  out  to  be  fentanyl.  this  is  why  i  talk  shit  about  xanheads
__label__c _U  your  program  helps  me  pay  for  uninsured  lyrica  by  pfizer.  thank  you!  #rxhelp
__label__c so  they  prescribed  me  oxycodone  and  fuck  i'm  into  it
__label__m People  are  doing  a  form  of  heroin  every  time  they  take  any  type  of  opiates.  Percocet,  Vicodin,  MS  Contin,  Oxycotin.  They’re  all  opium  derivatives.
__label__c _U  They  put  us  all  in  sud  box  so  we  can  all  be  prescribed  suboxone
__label__u nu  op  juize:  lyrica  anderson  ft.  wiz  khalifa  -  sex  you  up
__label__c _U  mine  almost  that  bad.  op  was  fine  tho.  loved  the  valium
__label__c I  am  considering  talking  to  my  new  doctor  about  other  alternatives  to  Seroquel.  I  am  really  over  the  side  effects  of  the  drug.  But  can  I  go  without?  It’s  been  the  most  effective  piece  of  my  recovery.  #MentalHealth  #Bipolar
__label__c _U  Dude  that’s  insane  My  psychiatrist  finally  freaking  listened  to  me  and  gave  me  Ativan!!  But  it  took  me  having  a  mental  breakdown  to  get  it!!
__label__c I  had  an  easier  time  getting  a  script  for  klonopin  than  I  do  getting  my  fucking  birth  control
__label__m _U  also  there  would  be  far  fewer  oxycontin  overdoses  if  it  didn't  contain  acetaminophen,  which  is  basically  kidney  &  liver  poison.
__label__m _U  _U  I  have  no  idea  what  alprazolam  is  for.    But  you  seem  quite  familiar.    You  a  doctor?    Didn’t  think  so.    Have  another  dose
__label__a i  snorted  adderall  and  i  was  so  focused  on  my  wall  it  wore  off  before  i  did  my  homework  i  hate  myself
__label__m _U  xanax  &  wine  for  you  or  the  kids?
__label__c _U  But  I  still  have  days  where  I  think  "My  god  it  would  be  so  much  easier  if  I  could  just  pop  a  klonopin  right  now."
__label__m _U  wat  of  tramadol  4  inspiration
__label__a popped  an  adderall  i'm  studying.  whoooo.  😁😂  _U

__label__m So  today  I  found  out  that  my  great  nan  did  not  die  of  natural  causes  but  was  given  3  doses  of  Diazepam  to  help  her  along  in  a  mercy  death  from  the  doctors  as  she  was  trying  to  starve  herself  to  death.  8  years  later  and  I  am  even  more  traumatised🙂

__label__u 10:46  Morphine  -  Honey  White
__label__a _U  It’s  so  weird  reading  your  tweets  and  being  able  to  relate  every  time.  I  used  my  morphine  pump  SO  many  times  just  to  get  a  better  sleep.  Probably  a  bad  idea  in  the  long  run  but  oh  well
__label__m _U  in  the  end  i  would  have  to  take  2x  as  many  tylenol  to  equate  to  to  the  strength  of  one  hydrocodone  which  is  bull
__label__a bro.  they  shot  me  up  with  morphine  twice  and  i  was  high  as  a  kite.  that  shit  knocked  my  ass  out.
__label__a nothing  like  staying  up  30+  hrs  on  adderall  :^)
__label__c _U  _U  i  have  cancer  i  was  prescribed  tramadol    but  had  to  come  off  them  bad  side  effects
__label__c so  yesterday  i  increased  my  lyrica  to  600  mg,  which  is  the  max  dosage.
__label__a _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  I'm  over  it.  Just  ate  7  Klonopin.      Cc:  _U
__label__c meds  review  done.  off  sertraline  and  going  back  on  venlafaxine  but  extended  release.  stay  on  olanzapine.  referral  to  sleep  specialist.
__label__m _U  Naencounter  ko  to  kagabi  one  patient  was  asking  for  Ativan  kasi  ilang  nights  na  sya  nananaginip  ng  dark  shadows.  Our  doctor  ordered  for  Psych  Consult  kasi  most  probably  it  is  due  to  stress  and  lack  of  sleep.
__label__m _U  _U  Looking  at  your  tweets  you  love  throwing  around  the  word  Nazi.  I  suggest  you  up  your  quetiapine  dosage.
__label__m Pass  me  the  Hennessy,  these  people  telling  me,  drink  so  much  whiskey  they  call  me  Sick  Jack  from  Tennessee,  we're  getting  stoned  again,  pop  a  Klonopin
__label__m _U  yes  for  ocd  and  bipolar.  klonopin,  buspar,  prozac  and  lithium
__label__c when  the  xanax  starts  to  kick  in...
__label__m Okay  so  Clonazepam  is  clonazepam  is  clonazepam
__label__m _U  I’ve  only  gotten  to  page  xi,  which  is  that  technically  a  page?  Anyway,  on  morphine.  I  remember  when  my  mom  was  like  46  minutes  away  from  her  last  breath.  Someone  thought  I  was  giving  her  too  much  morphine.  Like...she  was  going  to  become  ...an  addict?  #whatevs
__label__u can't  wait  to  dance  to  kehlan  and  lyrica  ❤️
__label__c “_U:  im  almost  out  of  adderall  😅😥”  back  to  eating
__label__a Anyone  know  of  a  website  that  sells  diazepam  that  actually  accepts  PayPal?  Sick  of  hearing  the  “having  trouble  with  our  card  system”  shit  🙄
__label__m cool,calm,  just  like  my  mom,  with  a  couple  of  valium  inside  her  palm,  it's  mr.  mischief  with  a  trick  up  his  sleeve
__label__m _U  Probably  xanax  usage  too  😉
__label__c seroquel  makes  me  so  fucking  tired  ouaghygggg  why  do  i  take  it  in  the  morning
__label__m PERHAPS  MIKE  WOULD  LIKE  TO  OLANZAPINE  I  MEAN  HE  HAS  TAKEN  NEARLY  EVERY  OTHER  DRUG
__label__a where  all  the  suburban  white  kids  with  adderall  prescriptions  at
__label__c if  adderall  really  helps  you  that  much  with  athletic  performance  then  why  wasn't  i  all-state  everything  in  high  school
__label__c Meds//  is  it  too  late  for  a  diazepam
__label__m _U  its  like  if  lauryn  hill  got  rlly  mad  and  high  on  adderall  if  thats  ur  thing  than  ya
__label__c It’s  amazing  how  I  act  when  I  don’t  take  my  Vyvanse  wow  adhd  is  something
__label__c _U  I  prefer  hydrocodone
__label__m _U  _U  I  would  fit  in  very  well!  I'm  sure  there  are  a  lot  of  DR's  prescribing  all  the  bored  housewives  Valium/  Percocet.
__label__m _U  wait  till  you  run  out  of  hydrocodone
__label__c "_U:  adderall  had  me  calculating  the  lowest  grades  i  can  get  on  my  finals  instead  of  studying"  on  god  !!!

__label__m _U  _U  Id  love  to  believe  this  _U,  but  these  people  are    not  only  doing  this  with  impunity,  their  base  is  sitting  in  their  trailers  shooting  oxycontin  ,and  cheering  them  on.  It  just  doesnt  seem  like  it  will  happen.
__label__m stop  doing  xanax  kids
__label__m _U  😂😂  the  tramadol  and  desperados  aren't  gonna  give  you  time  to  blaze  you're  gonna  be  catching  z's
__label__c i  need  a  fucking  xanax  and  my  bed
__label__c says  she  wants  me  off  diazepam  (for  anxiety)  so  i  can  feeeeeel  more.  our  time  is  up.  i  leave  &  she  looks  proud  like  she  actually  did  shit.
__label__m _U  i  would  need  valium  to  do  what  you  do.  and  possibly  cannabis  (  where  legal  of  course)...
__label__m my  tweets  may  have  just  been  a  little  angry  but  i  am  listening  to  tech  n9ne  and  that  shit  gets  my  blood  pumpin  like  adderall
__label__m _U  _U  All  drugs  come  with  side  effects  for  some  whether  they  are  natural  or  manufactured.    If  cannabis  oil  works  for  this  little  boy  and  others,  then  I  think  it  should  be  prescribed.    How  dangerous  is  oxycontin  and  morphine,  yet  it  is  prescribed  for  severe  pain  relief.
__label__m synedrex  is  like  taking  10x  adderall  and  4x  redbulls.
__label__c Just  when  my  body  seems  to  be  working  I  remember  it's  shit.  Morphine,  ice  cream  and  my  pillow  are  my  friends  today  #spoonielife  #spoonie

__label__m my  dog  is  addicted  to  adderall
__label__m _U  Would  be  interesting  to  investigate  how  easy  it  is  to  get  a  lifetime  prescription  for  Ritalin/Prozac  etc.  I've  seen  GPs  prescribe  it  after  a  10  min  consult
__label__c _U  I’ve  literally  only  seen  one  cute  doctor  in  my  life,  and  I  was  so  drugged  up  on  morphine  that  I  asked  him  if  it  was  “Cuties  in  the  ER  Night”  🤦🏻‍♀️
__label__a I’ve  pooped  like  8  times  today.  Shoutout  to  all  the  vyvanse

__label__m We  cannot  imagine  Yeshuan  on  their  own  olanzapine...    It  must  be  a  cover...    To  explain  what  they  are  doing,  away...
__label__m If  have  withdrawals  only  but  not  significant  pain  problems  Suboxone  (or  generic  buprenorphine  SL)  are  good  choices  with  slow  tapering.  If  significant  pain  only  controlled  with  opiates  should  not  quit  or  be  forced  to  as  no  real  appropriate  alternative.
__label__m _U  i  have  a  friend  on  aripiprazole
__label__m _U  So  after  staffers  came  out  to  defend  the  doctor  re  sleeping  pills  on  over  seas  trips,  now  they've  changed  the  drug  he  was  supposedly  handing  out  like  candy?    What's  next?    Oxycontin?
__label__a i've  been  popping  these  hydrocodone  pills  like  they  candy  lol
__label__m Have  a  small  penis?Yes?You  suffer  from  DID.This  causes  closing  of  the  throat.Try  Abilify
__label__c adderall  is  why  i'm  still  awake....
__label__m I  agree  with  all  of  that,  but  some  pain  patient  advocates  are  demonizing  fentanyl  and  buprenorphine.  I  disagree  with  those  people.  No  substance  should  be  demonized.  What  works  for  one  person  might  not  work  for  another,  for  one  thing.  Fentanyl  and  buprenorphine  have  their  place.
__label__m The  doctor  testified  the  teen  had  told  paramedics  she  had  taken  alcohol,  gabapentin  and  marijuana.  A  toxicologist  told  the  court  last  week  Fontaine  had  THC  and  alcohol  in  her  system  when  she  died.

__label__m _U  Paul,  how  do  you  sleep  at  night?  It's  morphine,  right?
__label__c my  doctor  up'd  my  dosage  of  adderall.  I  feel  like  I  can  see  sounds.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Does  that  include  his  friends  who  flooded  the  market  with  Oxycontin  and  just  bought  a  multi-million  dollar  home  in  California?  Or  will  he  invite  them  to  golf  with  him?
__label__a ah  yes.  a  ritalin  a  half  a  xanax  and  12  oz  of  cold  brew........the  gentleman’s  breakfast
__label__m Don't  forget  your  valium.  You're  severe  without  it.  But  abandon  never  goes  away;  faith  is  ever  out  of  reach.

__label__c stupid  adderall  won't  let  me  sleep  😭
__label__m yeah  adderall  is  cool  man,  but  have  you  tried  transcoding  the  information  into  dna  and  injecting  it  into  your  brain
__label__c they  gave  me  morphine  at  the  er  i'm  feeling  so  much  better  already
__label__m _U  i  swear  mets  should  offer  xanax  as  a  giveaway  to  calm  down  people.

__label__m _U  I  think  those  of  us  that  do  trauma  naturally  grow  adverse  to  using  morphine.    It’s  even  probably  worse  than  fentanyl  in  ACS  as  well.    I  use  it  for  little  ones  when  the  weight  based  dosing  of  fetanyl  is  too  tedious  for  the  nurses  to  mess  with.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  My  point  was  in  reply  to  your  claim  tramadol  doesn’t  cause  dependence.  That’s  simply  not  correct.

__label__c _U  oh  love  :-(  i'm  on  amitriptaline  &  pregabalin  for  my  nerve  pain  -  then  oxynorm  for  breakthrough.  the  pain  won't  be  helping

__label__m _U  Methadone  caused  it.  Legal  opioids.  They  go  to  illegal  when  they  can't  get  it.  All  you  did  is  make  drug  use  go  up.

__label__m It’s  really  funny  how  people  say  sports  keeps  kids  out  of  violence  and  drugs  when  it’s  obviously  not  true.  That  pitcher  literally  punched  himself  in  the  face  over  a  home  run.  And  half  the  NFL  beat  women.  And  y’all  know  your  college  sport  teams  binge  drink  and  pop  Xanax  like  candy

__label__m Years  ago,  I  began  noticing  that  on  days  when  air  quality  received  an  "F"  grade,  even  Fentanyl  was  ineffective.    I'm  certain  that  environmental  factors  (pollution)  are  contributors  to  negative  changes  in  our  health.  When  mold  spores  are  high  --  Tramadol  is  like  eating  a  TicTac.😕
__label__m _U  _U  2/2  much  pain  and  the  meds  were  so  weak.  They  did  give  her  morphine  when  they  took  out  the  chest  tubes  but  that  was  after  4-5  days  of  her  being  in  pain  and  only  getting  stuff  like  Tordol.  They  also  needed  her  to  fill  her  lung  back  up  because  it  was  dropped  during  surgery.
__label__a money,  girls,  and  xanax  make  me  happy
__label__m i  get  the  best  compliments  from  people  on  morphine  drips.  girl  tells  me  i  look  like  "the  old  superman"....ill  take  it  tho
__label__a found  an  adderall  whole  packing,  ftw.
__label__a my  friend  gave  me  xanax  made  into  pez,  i  don't  know,  it's  working  though.
__label__m _U  _U  My  nephew  died  of  a  Fentanyl  OD.    I  abhor  opiates.  BUT  the  epidemic  of  heroin  /  fentanyl  deaths  can  be  traced  back  and  attributed  to  relatively  safe  legal  drugs  (OxyContin  and  opiates  prescriptions)  being  heavily  to  restricted  now.
__label__c convinced  adderall  is  a  necessity  for  me  i'm  always  so  distracted
__label__a lmaooo  i  gave  a  xanax  and  he  took  em  and  was  like  what  was  that  advil  or  ibuprofen
__label__c _U  That’s  only  natural.  I’m  sure  you’ll  be  fine.  Think  positively,  it  really  is  worth  the  trouble.  In  my  case,  the  procedure  took  about  45  minutes  and  the  post-op  pain/discomfort  is  manageable  with  the  odd  morphine  shot  in  the  hip.
__label__a Lowkey..  highkey  wanna  try  adderall.  I  just  feel  like  I  could  finish  the  rest  of  my  work  for  the  semester  tonight.
__label__a Next  u  will  start  calling  up  the  social  work  out  ur  head  on  Valium  saying  u  want  to  see  ur  kids  and  wondering  why  they  wont  let  u  🤷🏻‍♂️

__label__c From  experience,  I  got  a  prescription  for  Marinol  just  too  see  if  it  helped  my  pain.  Low  dose  Marinol  plus  a  low  dose  hydrocodone  was  the  best  and  longest  lasting  pain  relief  I  ever  had!!  If  Marinol  were  cleared  for  other  uses  besides  anorexia,  vomiting  and  AIDS  wasting...wow!
__label__c Its  not  extortion,  its  ultimatum.  I  was  put  on  methadone  3  months  ago,  due  to  my  insurance  changing  and  nobody,  i  mean  nobody  would  take  me  in  to  painmgmt  in  NJ,  my  insurance  even  tried  calling  for  me.  The  answers  were  sorry  hes  to  damaged  were  interventional  pain  mgmt...

__label__a _U  took  some  adderall  to  help  me  study  and  this  shit  really  fucked  with  my  sleep  cycle  smh
__label__m If  Camila  delete  the  heroine  morphine  and  change  to  nicotine  woo  wee.  I  will  approve  INBTS  be  a  single
__label__a i  took  a  hydrocodone  for  my  cramps  and  im  kind  of  high  n  my  parents  are  having  me  do  house  work  i  cant  focus  my  guy
__label__c Xanax  sleeps  are  great  but  I’m  always  groggy  as  fuck  when  I  have  to  get  up.
__label__m _U  You  said  yesterday  you  were  given  morphine.  Surely  that  should  now  be  helping  with  your  excruciating  pain  now  🤔
__label__c i'm  finally  back  on  clonazepam  and  the  local  feels  global  and  everyone  in  the  world  is  with  me  tonight
__label__m story  of  when  I  was  just  a  shorty  And  how  I  became  hooked  on  val-i-um.  Valium  was  in  everything,  food  that  I  ate  The  water  that  I  drank  Fucking  peas  in  my  plate  She  sprinkled  just  enough  of  it  to  season  my  steak  So  everyday  I  have  at  least  three  stomach  aches  Now  tell  me
__label__c i  am  in  so  much  pain  right  now  i'm  debating  taking  the  tramadol  i  have  for  my  back,  but  i  don't  want  to  live  life  relying  on  painkillers.😞
__label__c _U  I  like  diazepam  and/or  remote  islands.
__label__m morphine  some  other  shit
__label__m _U  How  many  deaths  has  methadone  caused?    Are  you  really  ready  to  try  and  prove  that  methadone  is  safer  than  kratom?    If  you  can  prove  this  then  I  will  never  comment  on  your  twitter  again.    I  promise.
__label__c i  have  my  adderall  and  my  granola  bar.  all  is  good  in  the  world
__label__a i  knew  i  should  have    save  that  xanax  for  when  i    had  alcohol  fuck    -_U
__label__m instead  of  teaching  someone  what  focusing  is  and  why  it's  important.  they  give  you  adderall  for  the  rest  of  your  life.  wtf
__label__m _U  😕  vyvanse  stopped  that  shit
__label__m Have  a  small  penis?You  probably  have  Trichotillomania.This  causes  denial.Try  Abilify
__label__c _U  it's  worse  pain  than  my  leg  amputation  was.  or  rather  it  was.  i'm  quite  comfortable  right  now.  morphine  does  the  job.
__label__c _U  I’ve  refused  pain  medication  and  am  down  to  just  gabapentin  and  ibuprofen.  I  use  laughing  as  a  med.  My  doctor  can’t  believe  it.  If  I  could  get  ok  for  med  pot  I’d  stop  taking  anything.
__label__m I  love  how  Lil  peep  was  different  and  people  still  be  like  "tons  of  people  done  rapped  about  xanax  and  depression"
__label__u What  grave  site  Lyrica  visiting  #LHHH
__label__m _U  Maybe  like  an  Adderall  like  substance  that  helps  them  concentrate  but  is  banned?  🤷
__label__u @  lyrica  why  you  blep
__label__c _U  _U  THAT  explains  why  they  are  forcing  me  off  my  klonopin!!!!!    I’m  allergic  to  Requip.  What  else  can  one  take  for  Restless  Leg  Syndrome?
__label__a #ikeepcalmby  a  nice  cocktail  of  morphine  mixed  with  gin
__label__c _U  eating  too  many  carbs.  quetiapine  has  me  in  its  podgy  grip.  might  have  to  start  doing  slimming  world,  too.  x
__label__c I  became  suicidal  on  Ativan  4  years  ago.  Now  I'm  off  and  still  alive  thank  God  #IamChrisCornell
__label__m valium  needed  tomorrow.  word  to  mike.
__label__m "What  happened  to  the  days  of  listening  to  music  and  taking  a  bath?  Or  if  you  really  wanna  unwind,  a  handful  of  xanax  and  huff  some  glue"
__label__a I  go  to  write  in  my  journal  and  on  my  desk  there's  vodka,  xanax  dust,  and  an  unsmoked  cigarette.  My  girlfriend  must  of  been  here
__label__u _U  What  about  the  back  end  of  that  album?  Sister  Morphine  /  Dead  Flowers  /  Moonlight  Mile
__label__m might  jus  fuck  around  and  develop  an  extremely  crippling  xanax  addiction  that  will  inevitably  kill  me  at  a  very  young  age
__label__m Mother  Nature  needs  a  Xanax  and  a  massage.  #IrmaHurricane2017  #earthquake  #HurricaneJose  #Florida
__label__m She  had  no  idea  what  acid  was,  no  clue  what  xanax  did,  didn't  know  anything  about  meth,  very  little  about  weed
__label__c _U  Adderall  makes  my  dick  way  smaller
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Congratulations  on  your  recovery!  I  know  a  couple  of  people  who've  had  success  on  methadone.  Whatever  works  and  gets  you  back  on  to  recovery  is  ok  by  me.
__label__m have  boils  on  your  ear  lobes?you  probably  have  avoidant  personality  disorder.this  causes  mental  misplacement.try  adderall
__label__m _U  Keep  giving  free  methadone  for  life  is  wrong  .  Reduce  the  dose.
__label__m why  do  people  take  adderall  for  productivity  like  have  you  not  tried  a  venti  starbucks  i'm  literally  bouncing  off  the  walls
__label__m _U  you  should  not  use  adderall  if  you  have  severe  anxiety  or  agitation,  or  a  personal  or  family  history  of  tics  (muscle  twitches)
__label__c literally  can't  reply  to  all  those  replies,  i'm  on  morphine  and  seeing  double  lol  thanks  for  all  the  messages  of  support  though  🖒
__label__c i'm  pretty  sure  i  can  tell  the  difference  between  name  brand  and  generic  quetiapine  now.
__label__c but  i'm  still  so  relax  on  xanax  yeah!
__label__c making  a  appointment  for  a  cardiologist  and  getting  my  script  of  adderall  refilled  at  the  same  time  sounds  counter  productive.
__label__c Adderall  gives  me  such  bad  anxiety
__label__m Lamocondiol  (depressant)  Used  with  Cymbalta  to  treat  major  immature  disorder  Developed  in  1997  to  replace  Seroquel
__label__a Sniffing  Buprenorphine  in  Hazard  never  felt  so  euphoric
__label__c Always  had  this  love-hate  relationship  with  Lorazepam.  Can't  live  with  it,  can't  live  without  it.
__label__m *whispers*  you're  not  supposed  to  take  adderall  everyday.  ok,  i'm  done  now
__label__m _U  _U  Fentanyl  is  useful  in  pain  management.  I  had  a  family  member  suffering  an  aggressive  terminal  cancer,  and  fentanyl  made  her  last  days  much  more  tolerable.  Morphine,  dilaudid  etc  did  nothing.  Fentanyl  was  a  God  send.
__label__c i  took  an  adderall  b4  going  to  the  gym  &  now  i  can't  eat  this  delicious  smelling  food
__label__a it's  one  of  those  special  occasion  xanax  kind  of  nights.
__label__c also  this  doctor  seemed  weirdly  judgy  about  the  adderall  on  my  list  of  meds,  if  i  have  sleep  problems???  which  won't  fly  at  all  with  me.
__label__m “Feelin  like  Moses  I’m  all  in  her  Ocean,  I  part  it,  Divide  it,  Im  feelin  like  Moses.  She  switchin  Emotions  and  makin  them  faces  just  like  an  emoji.  Pineapple  Fanta,  Mixed  w/the  Xanax,  she  Lovin  the  Codeine”    Allow  me  to  break  this  down
__label__a Found  an  adderall  in  my  purse  10  minutes  before  my  10.5  hour  grave  ends.
__label__c if  oxycodone  can't  knock  me  out  then  i  must  reallyyyy  have  sleeping  problems  😳😳😳😒😒😒😒
__label__m _U  perhaps  try  injecting  morphine  into  your  eyelids  or  something
__label__a _U  I  got  you  a  diazepam
__label__c OMG!  Epiphany!  For...reasons...ran  out  of  Quetiapine.  Woke  up  this  morning  feeling  all...awake!  Dang,  it's  good
__label__m My  dads  been  on  morphine  since  Sunday  and  it’s  the  funniest  thing  ever
__label__c To  whoever  found  a  brand  new  Patagonia  backpack  with  an  Adderall  prescription  in  it...you're  welcome.  #killme
__label__c never  tried  seroquel  until  rn  actually

__label__m let's  fck  it  like  morphine  dayz  _U  lol
__label__c The  Valium  is  probably  helping  too.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  this  is  prob  why  she  pensioners  won't  be  tested.  they're  all  on  oxycontin  and  tramadol.
__label__c might  be  a  xanax  type  of  day  .
__label__m _U  you  just  reminded  me  i  haven't  done  the  methadone  balance  check  😢
__label__c _U  When  I  took  vyvanse  I  often  felt  really  overextended  st  the  gym,  even  having  trouble  breathing  afterward  sometimes
__label__a yesterday  i  wrote  40  pages  in  a  span  of  a  few  hours  on  an  adderall  high.  today  it  took  me  an  hour  to  write  2.  honestly,  adhd,  my  guy,  i  hear  ya  and  ur  valid  but  now  is  not  the  time.
__label__u lyrica  content?  rt  _U:  the  beat  is  sick  rt  _U:  [36%]  downloading  'typa  girl'
__label__u _U  Is  that  top  is  from  Power  Rangers  Mighty  Morphine??
__label__c “_U:  music  is  my  painkiller.”  oxycodone  is  mine
__label__c _U  Now  excuse  me  I  have  to  take  some  klonopin
__label__c My  nurse  said  "what's  your  pain  level"  and  I  said  "About  a  6.  I  wish  I  could  smoke  a  bowl  haha"  and  She  looks  at  me  like  I'm  crazy.  YEAH  BRENDA  CAUSE  YOU  PUMPING  ME  FULL  OF  MORPHINE  AND  NORCOS  IS  SO  MUCH  BETTER.
__label__m “People  take  adderall  for  cod,  I  only  had  my  keyboard  and  mouse”  -  Barney.
__label__m _U  _U  Same  tramadol  that  kids  would  empty  inside  codeine  and  gulp  like  it's  fruit  juice.  I  remember  being  in  Yola  and  overhearing  a  young  girl  planning  her  expenses  for  the  next  day.  Top  on  the  list?  Codeine  and  tramadol.
__label__c hsjdjsjfjajfjskfjshfj,  bodies  and  health  are  so  fuckin  messy  and  bizarre.  This  tweet  reminds  me  when  me  and  a  heroin  addict  were  joking  about  how  we  had  similar  wrist  scars,  just  that  mine  were  from  morphine  drips  and  his  were  from  heroin  needles.  dark  and  morbid  but  like,  funny
__label__m _U  _U  Take  a  Valium  Tom
__label__m _U  _U  I  would  have  to  look  into  tramadol,  but  in  the  animal  studies  done,  this  new  stuff  relieved  pain  and  there  weren't  withdrawal  symptoms  when  the  mice  were  taking  off  it,  but  it  is  a  mouse  study  and  that  really  doesn't  always  track  with  human.  so  we'll  see  how  it  goes
__label__a i  can't  believe  i've  been  getting  at  every  ride  ;  thank  you  xanax
__label__m _U  xanax  aren't  fireworks
__label__c the  neurontin  i'm  taking  just  makes  me  super  attentive  and  focused.  i  don't  get  the  euphoria  i  did  from  the  vicodin.  😕  that  was  my  shit!
__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine  Suddenly,  I’m  a  fiend  and  you’re  all  I  need  All  I  need  Oh,  yeah,  you’re  all  I  need    🎶
__label__c well,  fuck.    whilst  waiting  for  my  klonopin  +  percs  to  kick  in,  i  made  the  mistake  of  browsing  ebay  for  my  dream  ap  bras.    i  found  them  all.
__label__a _U  Right  there  with  you...  and  out  of  valium.
__label__m _U  thats  pretty  damn  sad  if  people  needa  take  xanax  to  figure  out  what  makes  sense  lol
__label__a Currently  running  on  15mg  Valium,  1mg  Ativan  and  90mg  Codeine.  I  got  that  chemicalised  feeling.
__label__u I  see  why  Lyrica  is  mad,  but  I  also  under  A1  position.  #LHHH
__label__u _U  The  bricks  are  fallen  down,  but  we  will  build  with  hewn  stones:  the  sycomores  are  cut  down,  but  we  will  change  them  into  cedars.  #civilists  #asenapine
__label__c I  HAVE  MORPHINE  AGAIN
__label__c _U  well  gp  has  said  to  take  those  pregabalin  as  and  when,they  are  incredibly  strong,(  side  effects  )  but  work,thanks
__label__m I  need  a  Klonopin  after  this  week’s  episode  of  #Homeland!  My  gosh!  My  heart  is  still  racing!
__label__a also  adderall  makes  u  skinny  so  i'm  so  here  for  it  honestly  tbh
__label__a Anyone  know  the  lethal  dosage  of  Ativan?  I  already  exceeded  my  daily  dose  by  50%  in  the  hopes  it  would  help  me  sleep.  Just  one  more  couldn’t  hurt  right?
__label__c _U  there  are  new  painkillers  called  gabapentin  and  they  have  worked  wonders  when  nothing  else  will  do.  they  are  really  good  as  is
__label__m _U  All  good  Faux-News  viewers  put  fingers  in  ear  and  chant  'la  la  la  la'  while  congressional  Republicans  chant  'donor  tax  cuts'  'donor  tax  cuts'    ...      then  take  a  valium.
__label__m said  a  wanted  an  armani  jacket  and  ma  wee  sister  has  just  and  ordered  me  one,  must  still  be  out  her  tits  on  morphine  from  the  hospital
__label__a _U  _U  same.  have  you  ever  tried  codeine  with  valium?  fucking  amazing.
__label__m tis  the  season  for  adderall  dealers
__label__a _U  well  i  do  smoke  weed  and  sometimes  it  is  a  8  am    better  than  then  taking  hydro  morphine  it  work's  great  for  back  pain  ☺☺☺
__label__a 20mg  Valium  and  50ml  of  XO  Cognac  says:  I  WILL  NOT  get  out  of  bed  on  trading-autopilot  tomorrow    #UKBankholiday
__label__m hydrocodone  is  "an  opiate"  and  while  this  is  technically  true  this  is  used  to  tie  it  to  heroin,  fentanyl,  etc.,  just  like  that  article  does.
__label__c first  day  in  a  week  i  haven't  taken  adderall  and  it  feels  gooooodddd
__label__c on  another  note,  i  could  easily  see  how  i  could  develop  an  addiction  to  morphine  😳😳..  this  stuff  is  so  relaxing  😂🤗💉💉
__label__c _U  _U  the  traz  may  be  a  good  option.  temazepam  and  ambien  doesn't  work  for  me.  seroquel  ir  is  my  current  best  option
__label__m _U  Champwititi  chabwititika.  Do  they  have  diazepam  or  Ritalin  in  the  States.
__label__a took  adderall  yesterday  then  got  turnt  at  night,  woke  up  after  4  hours  of  sleep  for  school,took  adderall  again,  then  went  straight  to  work  🤕
__label__c xanax  and  chocolate  milk  for  breakfast.
__label__m _U  _U  Yes,  it's  amazing  how  helping  a  corrupt,  zenophobic,  Adderall  popping  president,  will  zap  your  ratings.
__label__m _U  addys  and  ritalin  is  basically  meth,  it's  just  legal,  government  amphetamines  doctors  feed  to  kids.  shits  good  tho
__label__m _U  _U  Morphine  l  share  the  link  here...I  have  challenged  this  bugger,  terrorist...These  guys  took  away  my  cousin  n  friend...
__label__c when  you're  about  to  have  a  mental  breakdown  and  mom  is  nowhere  to  be  found  because  she  hides  the  xanax  (:
__label__c _U  i  totally  understand.    i  was  given  hydrocodone  one  time  for  what  the  docs  called  "the  mother  of  all  muscle  spasms",  didn't  like
__label__m really  need  a  bottle  of  wine  and  xanax  today
__label__m _U  _U  _U  I  need  Valium  after  watching  Rachel!  I  hope  Jill  isn’t  going  to  stress  me  out  even  more  !  #TheLastWord
__label__m so  just  googled  and  vyvanse  is  pharmacologically  engineered  to  have  an  idea  that  i  thought  i  was  clever  for  thinking  of  like  30  minutes  ago
__label__c _U  i  already  took  gabapentin  and  it  was  meh  so  i  think  my  dr  can  petition  for  it.  especially  considering  my  medical  history...they  prob  wanna  avoid  hospitalizations  but  sigh  i  really  hate  the  process
__label__u Lyrica  Anderson  X  dont  take  it  personal.  My  shxt.
__label__u _U  _U  _U  _U  I  think  she  is  a  Timmy  Lorazepam  fan
__label__a literally  fuck  everyone.  xanax  and  chill.
__label__c _U  _U  The  morphine  is  kicking  in...let's  all  go  for  a  road  trip  LOL
__label__m _U  use  adderall  bro
__label__m we're  done  w  xanax.  we  out  here  drinking  water  now.
__label__m A  xanax  would  be  ideal  right  now
__label__c started  my  morning  with  an  adderall  😂
__label__a lost  2  people  to  xanax
__label__m Perscription  opioids  are  not  over  prescribed.  Morphine  is  a  natural,  safe  and  effective  pain  control  substance.  All  other  arthritis  meds  cause  heart  disease  and  liver/kidney  damage.  The  "Opioid  Crisis  program"  is  used  to  hide  the  import  of  Heroin  from  Afghanistan.  Killing  60k  /yr
__label__m Then  again.  You  can  get  doses  up  to  400mg?  In  Seroquel?
__label__m i  think  this  boy  is  accusing  me  of  stealing  his  xanax.  ok
__label__c Why  can't  these  medical  professionals  realize  people  with  Ms  suffer  from  unbearable  pain  not  everyone  but  a  lot  of  us  and  let  us  take  this  Oxycontin  that  I  took  I  never  abused  it  ran  out  I  took  it  as  prescribed  and  it  worked  wonderful  now  you  can't  get  it  anywhere  what  a  joke
__label__m _U    Broke  ALL  records  of  a  President  ever  in  history  showing  his  ASS!  Again  Donny?  Really?  Pop  a  valium  &  go  to  sleep...
__label__m _U  extends  to  psychiatry.  Walgreens  will  flag  you  as  a  potential  abuser  (doctor  shopping)  if  an  ortho  gives  you  something  like  tramadol  while  you  regularly  take  clonazepam  for  extreme  anxiety.  It's  turning  into  a  stunning  crisis..but  hey  "just  say  no"  right?
__label__c is  it  bad  to  mix  xanax  and  adderall  because  my  anxiety  is  killin  me  and  i  need  to  get  this  shit  done  😂
__label__m my  uncle  future  said  he  took  56  xanax  bars  and  still  kept  drinkin  dog  he  doesn't  even  know  who  ciara  is..
__label__m _U  It’s  probably  seroquel.  They  administer  that  in  psychwards  and  prisons.  Side  effects  include  lethargy,  weight  gain,  inactivity,  and  numb  to  pain.
__label__c _U  gross.  adderall  =  gross
__label__m _U  they  need  a  xanax  or  somethin
__label__m Ano  how  do  people  get  Valium  prescriptions?  I’m  ever  hinting  at  my  doctor  but  he’s  just  giving  me  pills  for  crazy  people
__label__m _U  Is  your  Valium  hangover  gone?
__label__m _U  isn't  going  to  steal  your  #hamptons  pictures  people,  take  your  moms  xanax  and  chill.
__label__a love  too  take  adderall  recreationally  and  realize  that  i  actually  would  function  better  with  it  on  the  day-to-day
__label__m we  always  fuck  impassioned  xanax  and  their  trap  gf.  nigga  sex  good
__label__a two  cups  of  coffee  and  vyvanse  is  really  kicking  my  ass  right  now.
__label__c adderall  had  me  typing  faster  than  letters  appear  on  my  screen  😂😂😂
__label__c having  a  hole  in  your  foot  is  a  lot  less  funny  and  a  lot  more  pailful  when  the  morphine  wears  off
__label__u _U  I  mean  they’re  ok  if  you’re  scared  by  Morphine’s  use  of  saxophone
__label__c today's  productivity  is  brought  to  you  by  adderall
__label__m xanax  is  our  generations  version  of  crack
__label__a I'm  low  key  addicted  to  Xanax
__label__u I'm  glad  lyrica  and  A1  moms  gel  along
__label__m _U    people  also  routinely  died  from  infections  and  you  could  get  pure  tincture  of  morphine  without  a  prescription.
__label__m _U  I'll  get  u  some  morphine  Sherlock
__label__m peak  is  when  step  up  the  morphine  comes  on  straight  after  delete🙃🙃🙃🙃
__label__c i  mis  you  a  lot  im  on  zyprexa  lol
__label__a Zoey,  I  remember  my  first  Adderall  in  college.  Great  and  productive  times.  #grownish  _U
__label__u me  and  lyrica  going  turn  up  for  her  birthday  today  🤘🏽😂
__label__m _U  _U  Better  to  be  on  a  “well”  dose  of  methadone  only,  rather  than  getting  “well”  with  fentanyl
__label__m _U  how  do  docs  know  not  writing  prescriptions  to  a  100%  trafficker?  do  docs  do  regular  blood  tests  of  suboxone  prescription  patients?
__label__m _U  _U  I  think  Valium  has  no  influence  in  this.
__label__c _U  Not  that  i  plan  to  in  the  forseeable  future  but  please  share  your  Gabapentin  weaning  journey
__label__a Adderall  side  effects  being:  awesome  at  everything
__label__c took  3  of  my  fibro  meds  (celebrex  causes  gastric  pains)  and  imma  see  if  tramadol  helps  my  tummy  cos  it  has  before.
__label__m he  always  mess  with  wistful  xanax  and  their  dawg.  daddy  would  love  it
__label__c _U  _U  ppl  should  try  5mg  of  aripiprazole  or  olanzapine  just  once  to  see  how  debilitating  it  is  &imagine  my  20mg!
__label__c _U  I  live  with  chronic  pain,  I  also  have  endometriosis  which  makes  said  pain  worse,  I  got  a  kidney  stone,  the  ER  told  me  to  take  naproxin  &  something  else.  Naproxin  has  never  done  anything  for  me,  ever.  I  went  to  my  doc  &  he  goes  "That's  just  cruel!"  &  gave  me  oxycodone.
__label__m over  all,  drug  overdoses  now  cause  more  deaths  than  car  crashes,  with  opioids  like  oxycontin  and  other  pain  medications  killing  44  ppl/  day
__label__m percocet  and  codeine  please  don't  take  my  liiiiiiifffeeeeeee
__label__m have  you  eaten  today?yes?you  suffer  from  melancholia.this  causes  eventual  death. try  adderall

__label__c that  awkward  moment  when  you  need  a  xanax  to  get  in  the  car  as  staying  informed  w/  current  events  is  acute  awareness  that  you're  a  target.

__label__c _U  Without  my  Xanax  I'd  be  fully  non-functional.  It's  the  only  thing  that's  worked  at  all  for  my  anxiety/panic  attacks.  Not  "mindfulness."
__label__m _U  is  that  like  a  morphine  patch

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  suitcases  full  of  morphine  and  1-way  plane  tickets  to  mexico  ought  to  do  it.
__label__c _U  Have  been  recommended  cbd  oil  by  many  but  have  yet  to  get  any.  Doubtful  that  it  would  lower  number  of  attacks,  but  apparently  should  ease  pain.  That  said  so  does  the  tramadol  (opioid)  I  currently  take.

__label__c i  just  flew  on  a  plane  without  xanax  for  the  first  time  in  a  long  time!  🙌🏼
__label__m definitely  not  a  miracle  cure,  perhaps  slightly  better  than  clonidine  (same  class  of  drugs,  already  widely  used  in  US)  but  no  breakthrough.    friend  of  mine  was  in  a  UK  trial  of  it  for  detox  in  90s,  did  not  perform  better  than  methadone  taper.    &  of  course,  maintenance  =  safer.

__label__m _U  _U  depends  who's  choking  on  the  xanax.  if  it's  my  child  and  i'm  panicking,  xanax  can  totally  fix  that.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  painful  stupidity  almost  requires  oxycontin
__label__c replacement  with  Suboxone.  I  have  been  clean  for  8  years,  but  I  am  still  on  Suboxone,  and  I  always  will  be.  I  still  have  to  see  my  Dr  once  a  month,  even  though  I'm  stable.  Medicaid  was  the  program  that  saved  my  life.  I  would  be  dead  today  without  it.  This  plan  will  kill  people.  5
__label__c _U  i  couldnt  go  to  work  without  taking  a  tramadol  for  my  back  pain  does  that  mean  im  also  addicted  ?

__label__c i  forgot  about  everything  shout  out  to  the  xanax  💊😘✌🏾️
__label__c wake  up  suboxone  and  valium  then  shower  then  coffee  then  work  then  cry  then  write  something  then  think  its  shit  then  therapy  then  blunt

__label__m you  know  what's  funny?  xanax  backwards  spells  retard
__label__m _U  hashtag  adderall

__label__m What  is  MED?  I  know  a  person  who's  child  is  on  two  Norco  daily  and  needs  another  neurontin.  The  Norco  doesn't  last  12  hours,  so  he  doesn't  get  24  h  pain  coverage.  They've  begged  the  doctor  for  almost  2  years  now,  but  because  neurontin  has  just  become  controlled,  and  he's  already.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  Yes,  OxyContin  changed  things.
__label__m Xanax  is  the  root  of  all  evil
__label__c My  eye  is  throbbing.  Which  means  my  tumor  is  sitting  on  my  optic  nerve  right  now.  Which  means  I  need  to  take  this  oxycodone  and  go  to  sleep.
__label__c I’m  binging  on  transformation  tv  shows  (makeovers,  interior  design)  but  I  only  watch  the  last  5  min  of  each  episode  i  think  I  need  an  ativan  refill
__label__a Interviewer:  how  well  do  you  handle  stress?    Me,  thinking  back  to  the  Xanax  I  popped  right  before  the  interview:  tremendously  well.
__label__a 15.  I'll  go  ahead  and  answer  this  without  a  like...whiskey,  beer,  GTA.  xanax,  and  bong  rips.      Not  at  all  concurrently  or  in  that  order.
__label__m Please  leash  your  dogs,  those  that  dont.  My  Maltese  Maxxe  was  almost  killed  by  a  Great  Dane.  Morphine,  surgery,  antibiotics,  pain  pills  but  he  is  recovering  slowly.    His  "drains"out  soon.
__label__u i  knew  i  was  gonna  love  the  kendall/lyrica  content  but  she  rly  blessed  me  w  the  zach  vid  thank  u  _U
__label__m so  grateful  he  listened.  doesn't  think  gabapentin  is  any  use  which  it  isn't.  only.lowers  daily  headache  down  to  a  6/10.  overall,  good  visit
__label__c _U  yes,  only  all  of  them....that's  why  i  take  a  xanax  before  i  get  stuck  in  #conservugatory
__label__u Morphine  #CNCO  #BestBoyBand  #iHeartAwards

__label__u _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  probably  yes
__label__m _U  _U  _U  one  of  the  best  cough  suppressants  is  hydrocodone  &  it's  available  in  a  yummy  liquid.  #highhillary
__label__c _U  We  need  it  here  in  the  #UK.  Completely  fed  up  of  taking  morphine  for  pain  relief  and  having  to  cope  with  horrible  side  effects
__label__u the  rassmusen's  and  lyrica  are  my  only  friends  💗
__label__m um  why  didn't  I  know  before  this  that  my  uni's  health  center  handed  out  klonopin  like  candy
__label__m I  hope  retired  Air  Force  Lt.  Gen.  Thomas  McInerney  is  abducted,  tied  down  to  a  bed,  injected  with  morphine  until  he's  addicted  and  then  interrogated  by  former  K.G.B.  trained  torturers.    McCain  never  gave  away  secrets.    I'm  not  sure  Tom  would  conduct  himself  as  honourably.
__label__c i  took  a  valium  and  i'm  still  so  mad
__label__m LA  PARTE  DE  “JUST  LIKE  NICOTINE  HEROIN  MORPHINE”  LA  VOZ  DE  CAMILA  SUENA  HERMOSA  NO  PUEDO  SUPERARLA
__label__c Me  2  Pharmacist:  "  I  have  a  prescription  here  for  oxycodone"  Pharmacist:"Is  your  insurance  on  record?"  Me:  "Yes"  10  mins  later....  Me:"Picking  up  prescription  for  XXXXX"  Pharmacist:  "OK.  That'll  be  $2.50  co  pay.  Here  you  go."  Me:  "Thanks.  Oh  is  it  okay  to  mix  this  with  Sudafed?"
__label__m _U  Xanax  is  great
__label__a does  anyone  in  star  college  have  adderall  it's  an  emergency
__label__m _U  soundcloud  rapper  that  overdosed  on  laced  xanax
__label__m _U  thanks  Paul,  just  need  to  get  him  to  eat!  3  weeks  on  tramadol  and  tonight  on  methadone,  he's  looking  for  a  part  in  the  next  serious  of  #stillgame  as  Mick's  sidekick
__label__a i  sold  Tiger  woods  hydrocodone
__label__m My  dog  needs  an  order  for  xanax  on  Halloween  and  4th  of  July...      it’s  not  his  fault  😰
__label__c with  back  pain  for  the  last  2  weeks  i've  still  slept  the  best  i  have  in  years.  i've  also  coincidentally  been  taking  valium  during  this  time
__label__c just  realized  that  i  haven't  eaten  since  like  sunday  evening.  i  forgot  how  taking  adderall  everyday  totally  kills  my  appetite.
__label__c adderall  forces  me  to  use  the  stall  to  pee
__label__c i  did  ut  adderall  free  in  three  years
__label__a The  first  time  I  tried  Oxycontin  I  stole  it  off  a  dad  of  two  kids  in  the  West  Village  who  died  the  next  month  of  cancer  ...  I  was  18  and  their  au  pair  ...  There  will  always  be  gnarly  drug-driven  people  like  me,  but  don't  protest  big  Pharma  for  making  drugs  for  people  like  him
__label__m _U  🙏🏻please  let  it  be  slow  &  fatal  &  no  morphine
__label__c "while  i  was  taking  lyrica  my  cycles  doubled,  so  i  had  2  in  each  month."  ay  no!!!  dx
__label__m _U  _U  Addiction  is  genetic  you  greedy,  lying  sociopath!!!  We  get  it,  we  do!  You  want  everyone  to  use  suboxone  so  you  can  get  rich.  The  problem  is  FACTS.  Enjoy  it  now,  I  promise  you  will  be  exposed.#endthedrugwar
__label__m i  would  be  so  focused  if  i  was  prescribed  to  vivance  or  adderall  .
__label__a i  just  took  2  strong  ass  oxycodone  pills.  i  might  die  lol  but  i  took  2  before  and  was  sleepy  as  hell  .  smh  but  i  need  the  sleep
__label__m xanax  &  perks  stay  on  em
__label__m if  you're  gonna  do  drugs,  dont  be  an  idiot  and  show  up  to  work  fucking  off  xanax  you  idiot.
__label__c _U  We  were  right  along  with  you.  No  shame  in  what  happened.  My  wife  was  crying  and  my  pulse  is  beating  out  of  my  ears.  Had  to  take  an  Ativan.  We  are  being  held  hostage  by  35%  of  this  country.  You  did  fine  under  the  circumstances.
__label__m Unlike  those  who  get  addicted  from  pain-relievers,  "my  son,  it  turns  out,  he  passed  through  the  night  Sept.  8th."  _U,  and  he  had  bought  a  "hot  batch"  of  an  unexpected,  unprescribed  drug:  "He  took  a  Xanax  laced  with  fetanyl."

__label__c there's  this  photo  of  me  and  my  boyfriend  with  his  grandma  from  this  last  christmas  where  i  was  on  adderall  and  my  pupils  are  disc  of  black.
__label__c i  need  some  mothafuckin  god  damn  adderall  asap
__label__a _U  pot,  alcohol,  xanax  or  klonopin  works  better  for  me.  plus  daily  antidepressants  and  cake.
__label__a i  wanna  do  a  bar  of  xanax  and  get  really  drunk  and  not  remember  anything  tomorrow  like  everyone  else  does  around  here  😂
__label__c _U  i  might  just  go  ahead  and  get  the  xanax  out.
__label__a the  worst  part  is  that  there's  morphine  and  nortriptyline  in  my  house  so  i  have  the  easiest  access.  i'm  trying  so  fucking  hard.
__label__m this  nigga  prince  died  by  poppin  oxycontin  rip  prince  and  yams  tf
__label__c i'm  sitting  off  a  adderall  baking  in  this  heat
__label__m One  day  it’s  gonna  leak  out  that  vyvanse  and  adderall  actually  eats  away  at  brain  matter  and  impairs  cognitive  function  I  swear  there’s  no  way  that  stuff  is  good  for  our  health
__label__a _U  _U  Coffee  with  a  shot......tramadol  /  kenacort
__label__m _U  _U  very  cool.    i  was  hoping  to  hear  "high  on  xanax  and  wine  with  a  mic  stand  on  my  head".    maybe  next  time.
__label__m Have  general  forgetfulness?You  probably  have  Depression.This  causes  denial.Try  Abilify
__label__u lyrica  anderson-  hold  you  down  cover  🙌🙌
__label__m _U  _U  A  miscarriage  of  justice  results  in  the  prosecution  of  an  innocent  person  (look  it  up).  She  HAS  broken  the  law  in  Egypt.  Tramadol  is  a  huge  problem  in  the  developing  world  (read  the  article).  Also  it  is    you're  not  your  #literacyfool  #knob
__label__m i  used  to  think  when  people  in  yakima  said  they  had  addy  they  meant  adderall  lmao  but  i  figured  it  out
__label__c but  in  a  psychiatrist  hospital  you  get  your  pills  in  a  cup  and  that's  it.  once  or  twice  they  put  me  on  valium  without  me  knowing
__label__m Quetiaprogine  (insulin)  Used  with  quetiapine  to  treat  ruthless  fever  Developed  in  1983  to  replace  Geodon
__label__c _U  I  was  on  tramadol  but  became  allergic.  Occasionally  neck  old  stock  if  pain  too  much  but  it's  a  bit  like  Russian  Roulette.  Ditto  diazepam.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  remember  those  days  well  (kinda)  15-20  mg  oxycodone  every  4  hours...life  was  but  a  dream!
__label__m her  family/psychiatrist  told  her  that  seroquel  is  for  yeast  infections,  so  she  is  at  least  taking  that.
__label__m _U  Outgrown  mullet  w  tattoos  and  ativan  on  hand  24/7....  thank  gd  i'm  fit  for  somewhere
__label__c _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U    landed  me  in  the  methadone  clinic...    mmmm  methadone  😍    😂
__label__c Im  at  school  and  I  just  dropped  the  powder  in  my  vyvanse  pill  on  my  keyboard..
__label__c popped  a  valium  now  im  snoozin
__label__c _U  _U  I  metabolize  Fentanyl  far  faster  than  average.  Even  extremely  high  doses  of  morphine  barely  touch  my  pain.  Oxycodone  does  good  but  still  requires  higher  doses.  Oddly  Hydrocodone  works  fantastic.  But  need  higher  doses  for  it  too.  Currently  working  up  higher  in  oxy  w/new  dr.
__label__c I'm  anxiety  free  thank  you  xanax  &lt;3
__label__c i'm  unable  to  function  today  since  i  used  all  my  energy  yesterday/last  night  and  i  can't  take  my  last  vyvanse  because  i  won't  sleep  😪
__label__a _U  I  got  one  last  year  they  suck  then  my  mom  gave  me  some  oxycodone  and  i  was  high  af
__label__c never  taking  adderall  again  at  1  pm
__label__m _U  I  know  right!    To  me  it's  just  morphine  for  masochists.
__label__c it's  just  really  nice  not  to  need  an  ativan  every  damn  day.  i  can't  really  work  myself  into  anxiety  at  all  now.
__label__m ¡the  king  of  the  xanax!    #LilPeep
__label__m beautiful  day  in  wilmington...can  almost  taste  the  xanax  dust  in  the  air.
__label__m i'm  in  serious  need  of  some  adderall
__label__m like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine.  suddently,  I'm  a  fiend  and  you're  all  I  need
__label__m _U  Unfortunately  probably  the  same  as  the  rest  of  us.  A  Xanax  and  some  wine.
__label__m A  tabloid  at  the  grocery  store  says  Nicole  and  Keith  are  breaking  up  and  now  I  need  a  valium.

__label__c _U  been  reducing  olanzapine  and  i  can't  sleep  4  long  either.  was  on  zopi  in  past  but  found  difficult  to  get  off  it
__label__m you  taking  a  5-10mg  of  prescribed  adderall  ORALLY  daily  is  not  the  same  as  SMOKING  5-10mg  of  meth.  taking  meth  orally,  though...  about  the  same  effects.  tldr  meth  isnt  harmful.  unless  smoked.  neither  is  adderall.  unless  smoked  (?)  its  all  about  the  way  you  administrate  the  drug.
__label__a _U  _U  _U  I'm  about  to  take  a  muscle  relaxant,  a  pain  pill,  AND  a  Lyrica.  I  should  have  some  alcohol,  too.
__label__a getting  excited  bc  i  found  adderall  in  my  room..  #collegelife

__label__a he  finally  came  got  home  from  work  and  i  took  6  xanax.  i  could  barely  grip  my  phone.  my  arms  and  hands  were  tingly  and  numb.  i  couldn’t  calm  the  fuck  down.
__label__c my  god  i  took  one  look  at  the  #ga06  results  and  had  an  attack  of  ptsd.  i  can't.  i'm  going  to  be  hoarding  ativan  until  nov  '18.
__label__c adderall  with  nothing  to  do  is  as  close  to  hell  as  you  can  get.
__label__m _U  Yeah,  fair  call.  57  used  to  be  my  regular.  I  particularly  enjoyed  the  stops  near  Ozanam  House  and  the  methadone  pharmacy.
__label__c _U  _U  i  need  to  take  an  ativan  before  i  can  go  back  and  reread  it.  'ni**a,  ur  arguing  w  the  man  who  created  a  genre'
__label__c the  side  effects  of  gabapentin  are  bloody  horrible  and  damn  inconvenient!  #multiplesclerosis  #wonderinghowistandup
__label__m _U  take  a  xanax  before  you  have  a  coronary  donald.
__label__m ....this  tramadol  abuse  is  getting  out  of  hand
__label__u _U  Touching!  Soo  good  song.  And  lyrica  soooooo  touch.  Jae  voice's  soo  deep,  emotional  and  amasing!  D.ear  too  good  voice
__label__a this  adderall  better  keep  my  awake  all  day  since  i  was  up  late  asf  😅
__label__a Ever  take  tramadol  and  Percocet  together?  That  shit  make  you  a  superhero  and  shit.
__label__m _U  Merry  christmas  💜.  Hope  radical  christians/muslims/jews/alt-right/sjws/etc.  can  all  take  a  Xanax  and  chill  the  fuck  out  this  season.
__label__m _U  need  a  it  more  morphine  lol
__label__c _U  Always  preferred  tramadol  personally  🤪
__label__u Yooo  Safaree  story  line  on  #LHHLA  is  about  to  be  about  him  smashing  Lyrica!!!!  YOOOOO...  Brandy  and  Princess  Love  getting  into  it!!!  This  season  bout  to  be  bomb
__label__m ppl  on  twitter  arguing  with  ppl  tweeting  "xanax  is  a  horrible  drug  stop  doing  it"  u  all  look  dumb  as  fuck  don't  @  me
__label__m going  from  greg  brown  to  vin  scully  is  like  drinking  warm  milk  in  a  spa  after  blasting  adderall  at  fight  club  for  mad  max  reenactment  night
__label__m Have  suicidal  thoughts?You  probably  have  an  extra  chromosome.This  causes  immediate  death.Try  Abilify
__label__c risperdal  makes  me  groggy  as  fuck,  i  hate  it.
__label__m _U  my  old  boss  used  to  always  joke  about  valium  found  it  funny
__label__a maybe  taking  vyvanse,  a  5  hour  energy,  2  hydros,  and  drinking  almost  half  a  bottle  of  peach  amsterdam  vodka  wasn’t  a  good  idea  but  it’s  too  late  to  go  back  now  😂😂
__label__a all  these  tweets  tweets  for  the  next  6  hours  have  been  endorsed  by  ciroc  and  oxycodone  and  balmain  jeans  by  kid  cudi
__label__m and  plus  no  wifi  like  there's  no  way  i  could  stay  sane  on  that  shit.  i'd  need  a  good  few  xanax  and  maybe  some  whiskey...
__label__c What  kind  of  day  am  I  having?  I've  been  up  2  hours  &  have  decided  to  take  a  Xanax  *now*  instead  of  mid-screaming  fit  of  rage.
__label__m have  dependency  issues?yes?you  suffer  from  bulimia.this  causes  skin  to  turn  orange.try  methadone
__label__m ._U  _U  Important  info  but  “Cash-only  Suboxone  clinics  fuel  fears  of  new  ‘pill  mills”  headline  likely  to  add  to  stigma.
__label__c i’m  my  most  perfect  me  on  xanax
__label__c Also,  I  just  asked  a  nurse  how  long  this  bag  of  morphine  is  supposed  to  last  and  she  said  "well,  it's  complicated,  you  have  to  do  math  and  stuff",  so...
__label__m First  time  hitting  legs  since  I’ve  been  back  at  the  gym  and  I’m  walking  around  my  house  like  I  popped  a  Xanax
__label__a hell  yeah!  i  got  to  pop  some  oxycodone  tomorrow
__label__c _U  _U  i'm  prescribed  120mg/day  sustained-release  morphine  &  not  an  issue.  never  have  cravings  or  anything;  just  works.
__label__m _U  I  mean,  what  the  fuck  doctor  prescribing  alprazolam  and  clonazepan?  Please!  Give  a  break  for  god  sake!
__label__c adderall  got  me  organizing  mia's  clothes  by  month  seasonal  shades  of  the  same  color  and  bagging  up  stuff  that  doesn't  fit  anymore  lol
__label__c As  a  result  of  my  Psychiatrist  not  prescribing  Tramadol,  in  absence  of  my  Physician,  I  am  now  plagued  with  Baker's  Cysts,  the  worst  behind  my  knee.  Under  new  PM,  I  now  have  enough  to  take  the  edge  off  of  the  pain,  get  X-Rays  done  and  search  out  Ortho  Doctor  for  long-term  care.
__label__m I    called  him  a  sadist,  pain  fetishist,  depraved  heart  murderer,  Suboxone  pimp  still  haven’t  gotten  my  gold  star.  I  think  he’s  not  blocking  anymore  of  us  out  of  spite.  He’s  so  very  deranged  he  won’t  even  give  us  the  dignity  of  blocking  us.  He’s  Pure  Evil!!
__label__c Damn  these  tramadol  make  you  moody  as  hell  I  thought  predzone  was  bad.
__label__m _U  He'll  come  out  a  read  a  prepared  statement  like  he  has  been  dosed  with  1000cc  of  Valium.  He  doesn't  give  a  shit.
__label__c Tramadol  with  some  sleepy  time  tea.  Oh  I'm  about  to  be  knockedddddd  out.
__label__m _U  _U  Keep  taking  Valium  at  night.  His  supporters  are  ecstatic  that  there's  finally  a  president  as  ignorant  as  they  are!
__label__a _U  tested  positive  for  meth  but  it  was  actually  adderall  (which  shows  up  the  same  as  meth  on  drug  tests)?
__label__m we  need  to  stay  in  afghanistan  basically  forever  because  that's  where  big  pharma's  poppy  fields  are  located.  oxycontin  anybody?
__label__a snort  an  adderall  off  a  toads  back
__label__c let's  take  a  vote  should  i  take  vyvanse  at  2:46  in  the  afternoon,  yes  or  no
__label__a _U  _U  try  diazepam  and  mdma  together  its  a  similar  feeling  i  guess.
__label__m im  still  entertained  by  the  adderall  a  glass  of  whiskey  and  diesel  jeans  vine
__label__c Never  did  I  experience  physical  w/d  from  an  opiate  until  getting  off  of  Suboxone  cus  it  was  the  only  time  I  took  an  opiod  daily.  For  me,  Suboxone  worked  opposite  of  it's  intended  purpose  &  stories  like  mine  need  to  be  shared  to  demonstrate  MAT  is  far  from  being  a  magical  cure-all
__label__a _U  i  mean  do  i  really?  have  to  think  hard  ab  that  since  im  doing  morphine
__label__u Why  is  Lyrica  all  in  the  corner  by  herself  like  that?  😂😂😂
__label__m _U  it  definitely  is.  i  have  a  friend  whose  parents  made  her  go  on  adderall  to  force  her  to  stop  eating  i  was  like  wtf.
__label__m J.  Cole  is  combating  the  Xanax  epidemic  by  creating  music  that  produces  the  exact  same  effects  as  Xanax.  What  a  hero  to  this  generation

__label__m they  sure  make  xanax  and  adderall  taste  bad.  is  this  to  try  and  deter  abuse?
__label__m _U  i’m  addicted  to  nbts  just  like  nicotine  heroine  morphine
__label__u but  yall  not  fuckin  wit  the  lyrica  anderson  is  yall👀
__label__m If  Amir  Khans  account  hasn't  been  hacked,the  dude  needs  some  valium  and  a  lie  down  in  a  dark  room.

__label__c someone  should  give  me  a  fucking  trophy  for  being  perscibed  20mg  of  adderall  a  day  and  still  somehow  not  taking  it  and  functioning.
__label__m 'the  sky's  awake,  so  i'm  awake.'  'she  definitely  did  adderall  that  day.'
__label__c _U  i  been  up  since  8  am  yesterday  day  i  can  use  some  mud  to  balance  out  the  adderall  fuck
__label__c wow  i  am  NOT  doing  as  much  gabapentin  as  i  have  done  in  the  past  2  days  again
__label__m Actually  we  should’ve  elected  a  borough  president  who  will  taint  our  entire  water  supply  with  a  low  dose  of  Ativan
__label__a this  coffee  and  vyvanse  are  the  only  things  getting  me  through  this  day...
__label__a _U    will  pay  $$$  to  listen  to  klonopin  at  least  once  today
__label__m _U  _U  making  morphine  number  one  of  the  questions  mrs.  erg  is  to  say  yes  to  if  the  doctors  ask.
__label__m A  50+  year  old  housewife  on  #rhoc  can  take  an  addy,  Xanax  nyquil  drink  and  go  to  the  hospital  all  in  one  night
__label__u Lyrica  should  of  done  all  that  when  her  &  Moniece  was  face  to  face  the  first  time.  Don't  wait  to  get  w  your  entourage  cause  Mo  ain't  scary.

__label__m _U  Here's  a  good  spin  on  opioid  deaths,  let's  blame  over  the  counter  codeine  -  that'll  divert  attention  from  the  hundreds  of  OxyContin  deaths,  and  minimalist  the  effects  on  Big  Pharma  profits.  History  will  not  be  kind  to  _U.  It's  no  accident  that  he  is  pocket  sized.  #auspol

__label__c _U  I've  got  to  ask  my  doctor  about  Xanax  tomorrow.  My  anxiety  is  through  the  roof
__label__m _U  If  they  can  make  Suboxone  affordable  to  the  addict  ,  that  would  be  a  great  answer  but  they  think  since  you  can  afford  heroin  they  can  charge  you  6  or  $800  for  the  Suboxone
__label__m _U  _U  naw  people  are  just  ignorant  and  call  anything  with  oxy  in  it  a  perc.  its  prolly  a  15mg  oxycodone

__label__m _U  absolutely  impossible  to  find  in  CLE.  it'd  be  easier  to  find  methadone,  which  is  fucking  ridiculous.
__label__m There  is  a  prescription  drug  problem  in  Canada.    Marijuana  has  the  same  road  side  test  as  hard  prescription  drugs.  Why  is  it  just  marijuana  the  police  are  concerned  about?    Why  has  there  not  been  a  push  for  a  better  roadside  test  for  oxycontin.  dilodid,  or  vicodin,  etc..  #cdnpoli

__label__m I  literally  look  like  a  foot  today  and  some  guy  came  up  to  me  at  the  gas  station  and  asked  me  if  I  have  a  boyfriend.  Funny  story  is  we  were  in  a  sketchy  part  of  town  and  I  thought  he  asked  if  I  had  morphine  😂  otherwise  I  would  have  lied  and  said  yes  because  I'm  awkward.

Strangely  enough  I  never  felt  policed  in  my  use  of  the  Oxycontin  -  I  did  ask  the  Drs  about  its  addictive  properties,  so  I  knew  to  take  it  cautiously.

__label__c i'm  surprised  i'm  not  a  drug  addict  yet  with  the  amount  of  times  i've  been  prescribed  oxycontin  for  my  shoulder  lmfao
__label__m the  problem  with  buprenorphine  &  methadone  mr.  _U  is  you're  simply  trading  one  addiction  for  another.    the  u.s.  needs  ibogaine  clinics.
__label__m my  dad  is  currently  taking  morphine  after  trapping  a  nerve.  morphinedad  is  adorable  and  hilarious.  things  he  has  done  so  far:
__label__a adderall  and  coffee  is  on  the  menu  for  tomorrow
__label__c _U  My  best  advice  is  to  schedule  your  surgery  for  the  last  one  on  Friday  afternoon,  take  the  two  Valium  tables  and  go  home  and  straight  to  bed.  Sleeping  as  long  as  you  can  keeping  your  eyes  closed  that  first  night  &  day  pays  off  big  time.
__label__m _U  no.  that's  why    valium  was  invented.
__label__a i've  met  the  devil,  he  sold  me  xanax
__label__m _U  In  Spain,  to  get  methadone,  you  just  need  to  ask  it  and  wait  24  hours...
__label__m _U  It's  a  bunch  of  words,  morphine  and  Anze  something
__label__a guess  who  has  valium
__label__m _U  There  shouldn’t  even  be  a  debate.  HAT  works.  Same  for  SIFs.  The  irony  with  HAT  is  that  this  was  the  trx  approach  in  early  1900s  for  morphine  addiction.
__label__c adderall  is  great  when  ur  trying  to  get  through  the  day  until  ur  wide  awake  at  3  in  the  morning  &  can't  sleep  :))

These  withdrawal  symptoms  are  killing  me.  Omg.  It’s  not  as  bad  as  it  was  when  I  went  off  of  Ativan  but  it’s  up  there.  😥😷🤢🤕
__label__m I  just  finished  up  a  doc  about  Adderall  where  data  shows  that  there's  not  really  any  measurable  difference  in  performance  of  college  students  without  ADHD  who  take  the  medication  and  those  who  take  placebo.    The  only  difference:  kids  who  took  it  FELT  like  they  did  better.    WILD.
__label__m Depression  and  anxiety  aren't  an  excuse  to  take  Xanax  ,  there's  plenty  of  other  ways  to  cope  with  that  shit.
__label__c kids.  a  lot  of  kids  don't  have  money  and  they  are  always  hungry.  i  never  really  ate  much  bc  i  was  on  adderall  so  i  just  buy  my  friends  shit.

They  are  like  tranquilizer  to  my  body  a  small  dose  of  2mg  was  making  me  fight  for  breathing.  most  of  my  problem  was  not  knowing  how  to  communicate  with  my  caseworkers  and  Dr.  through  symptoms,values,&  error  recognition😇

Horrific  accident,  she  posted  pain  meds  liquid  morphine  etc.  Now  she  is  begrudging  people  in  pain?!  She  is  believing  MSM  which  she  said  we  should  ignore.  I  thought  she  had  more  class.
__label__c or  is  the  adderall  making  me  better  hmmm.
__label__a _U  I  KNEW  I  was  doing  something  wrong  on  the  long  haul  flights.    I  need  to  add  the  Valium!  The  vodka  alone  isn't  cutting  it.

My  nose  is  swollen  and  completely  covered  in  bandages,  all  around  my  eyes  is  starting  to  look  bruised.  I  was  prescribed  oxycontin  but  it’s  not  even  helping,  I’m  sitting  here  in  my  recliner  just  crying  in  pain  😍💞🔥
__label__m _U  Uh  oh,  time  to  start  tweaking  out  junkies,  get  some  Suboxone.
__label__m Have  ambiguous  genitalia?You  probably  have  Premature  Ejaculations.This  causes  closing  of  the  throat.Try  Methadone
__label__m Also  this  is  a  bit  simplistic  because  Vyvanse  isn't  technically  speed,  which  is  amphetamine  which  is  prescribed  therapeutically  as  Adderall  (which  is  technically  dextroamphetamine).    Vyvanse  is  lisdexamfetamine  which  is  a  substituted  amphetamine.
__label__c _U  i  got  it  because  adderall  gave  me  really  bad  ticks.
__label__m i  am  illiterate.  these  tweets  are  typed  by  my  manservant  named  "clams"  who  deciphers  them  from  my  morphine-fueled  rage  drawings

__label__m _U  _U  Oh  I  see  now  the  person  referenced  suboxone,  a  narcotic,  rather  than  the  antidepressants/antipsychotics  you  can  learn  he  was  previously  on  shortly  before  the  incident  if  you  do  some  digging  online.
__label__c The  doc  always  told  me  wait  15  mins  till  the  Xanax  will  start  breaking  down  in  your  body  and  start  to  work,  it’s  been  about  15  and  I’m  still  feeling  anxious
__label__a ativan  and  vodka  because  ????  its  a  wednesday  why  not

__label__c That  tramadol  had  me  dead  all  day  😭    that  shit  took  all  pain  away  tho
__label__m _U  Lil  Peep  took  6  Xanax  and  he  was  lit,  after  that.  Death!
__label__c tramadol  is  a  beautiful  thing
__label__m Have  migraines?Yes?You  suffer  from  Kleptomania.This  causes  eventual  death. Try  Methadone
__label__m Apparently  iHartJane  didn't  like  my  comment  about  5150  bars  and  klonopin
__label__m _U  So  now  addicts  get  methadone  for  free  and  assistance  in  shooting  up.  Democrats  are  becoming  more  and  more  of  a  joke.

__label__a taking  adderall  can  be  dangerous  because  instead  of  studying  you  just  accidentally  hard  core  pinterest  for  4  hours  straight
__label__m _U  "I  have  morphine  in  the  lab  for  your  pain...  Do  you  mind  coming  with  me?"    Sighing  heavily,  he  put  his  glasses  back  on.  This  worried  him.  A  lot.
__label__c _U  I’m  really  not  sure  😂Tramadol  helps  me  sleep  a  little  doesn’t  do  much  about  the  pain  and  Vicodin  helps  pain  but  doesn’t  help  me  sleep  🤣🤣🤣🤣
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Administer  iv  morphine?  That  went  out  with  Harold  Shipman.  No  one  in  right  mind  would  take  this  dangerous  step..

__label__m _U  It  is  rumored  that  CNN'S  Race-Baiter  DON  LEMON  was  spotted  at  the  local  Methadone  Clinic  right  before  making  his  Trump  Bashing  comment.  Lemon  is  paranoid  and  sees  Russians  everywhere  he  looks!

__label__m _U  Jk  Xanax  is  retarded
__label__m Purdue  Pharma  was  one  of  the  most  successful  in  this  regard,  driving  sales  of  OxyContin  up  from  $48  million  in  1996  to  $1.5  billion  in  2002
__label__c i  just  learned  that  valium  is  a  tranquilizer  🙃  the  dentist  gives  me  tranquilizers  wtf😭

__label__m Morphine  Codeine  Promethazine  THC  Hydrocodone  Norcodeine  Dihydrocodeine  Hydromorphone.  This  all  the  shit  chief  kief  had  in  his  system  when  he  got  arrested  💀🤣💀🤣

__label__a Mixing  20mg  of  Ambien  with  Valium  and  Baclofen  is  a  bad  idea,  in  case  anyone  didn’t  know  that  already  😑
__label__c _U  not  with  the  drugs,  thank  dog.  gabapentin  did  that  to  me,  though!  sounds  like  my  hands  feel  with  ulnar  nerve  entrapment.  yuck
__label__a got  head  from  a  bitch  name  sandy  forgot  everything  shoutout  to  the  xanax

__label__c i've  come  to  the  conclusion  that  ativan  is  the  drug  directly  from  god  himself  #icuproblems

__label__m _U  Lame  as  usual.  Give  it  up  already,  he  doesn't  even  know  you  exist.  Go  down  a  bottle  of  Vodka  and  Xanax  and  go  to  "sleep".
__label__m heroine  morphine  makes  more  sense  woo  wee  is  silly
__label__a so  who  wants  to  lace  my  food  with  xanax  so  i  can  relapse  cus  apparently  im  to  much  of  a  bitch  to  just  start  back  myself

__label__c These  Are  The  Days  When  I  Miss  Xanax  😩
__label__c _U  _U  ...  DC...  fuck  and  I  call  myself  a  nerd.    Fucking  tramadol.
__label__a who  needs  kush  molly  or  adderall  in  denton
__label__c idk  why  i  took  this  tramadol  'cause  i  knew  it'd  make  me  mad  wtf  lol
__label__m Have  suicidal  thoughts?You  probably  have  Bipolar.This  causes  infertility.Try  Xanax
__label__c I  hate  the  fact  that  a  side  effect  of  Valium  is  the  fucking  hiccups.  Like  I  just  wanna  sleep  off  this  migraine  leave  me  alone
__label__m _U  adderall  loud  and  buttershots
__label__m Welcome  to  surprise  where  thrasher  edge  lord  druggies  OD  on  Xanax  in  the  middle  of  class.  So  glad  I  am  out  of  high  school.
__label__c _U  i  told  them  i  don't  wanna  be  medicated.  vyvanse  already  fucked  me  up.  so  i  chose  to  meditate  when  i  freak  out  instead.

__label__a taking  xanax  like  a  fucking  tic  tac
__label__m _U  adderall  is  how  humans  should  be
__label__c _U  Gabapentin  immediately  drove  me  into  deep  into  depression.  Physical  therapy  helps  a  little  but...fuck  if  I  know.
__label__u TBH  lyrica  is  way  to  pretty  for  A1  hes  such  a  diva  he  is  not  lit  hes  not  poppin  SO  this  new  LHHH  trailer  hes  being  such  a  diva  and  i  love  that  Kmichelle  snatched  his  wig

__label__m _U  So  this  guy  takes  xanax?
__label__m _U  She's  sleeping  right  now.  They  ended  up  giving  her  morphine  for  pain.
__label__c Been  taking  a  suboxone  break  the  last  couple  days  &  my  goodness  it  feels  amazing  to  have  my  medication  &  ROA  of  choice.    It  gives  me  life.
__label__c _U    awesome  game  xept  i  ran  out  of  xanax  during  ot,  got  2  refill  b2  final  4

__label__a "i  can't  take  any  more  xanax  today..."  -  momma
__label__c _U  I  remember  about  18  years  ago,  I  was  prescribed  OxyContin,  and  it  did  nothing  for  my  pain  relief!  I  never  understood  that?
__label__u Okay  but  Lyrica,  Alexis  isn't  "shady"  she's  disrespectful  as  fuck  and  pressed.
__label__m _U  Then  klonopin
__label__a my  little  sister  is  lit  af  on  morphine  and  still  knows  when  to  say  please  and  thank  you.  my  momma  has  done  her  job  well
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Adderall.  That's  adderall.
__label__c trying  to  be  emotional  on  adderall  is  pointless  asf
__label__m _U  _U  we  already  know.  they  have  tramadol  and  it’s  doing  nothing
__label__c So  I  am  now  over  72  hours  lyrica  free.  This  sucks!!!    I  cant  wait  for  the  withdrawals  to  be  over.  I  only  wish  I  wasn't  going  to  have  permenant  issues  from  it.
__label__m Give  me  some  morphine.  Is  there  any  more  to  do?    Just  let  me  know  I'll  be  at  the  door,  at  the  door.
__label__a Really  don't  want  to  take  a  klonopin  because  it  makes  me  daft  for  30  hours  and  i  need  to  be  able  to  study  this  weekend,  but  I'm  getting  seriously  sick,  in  a  flu  and  fever  way,  and  i  want  to  sleep  it  off  to  recover  quickly
__label__m _U  _U  Take  a  Valium  smoke  a  joint  relax  it  ain't  going  to  happen
__label__a living  with  my  mom  is  soooooooooo  annoying.  she's  like  why  did  u  open  a  diet  coke  it's  almost  8?  bitch  i  popped  an  adderall  at  3  so  what?
__label__m adderall  flavored  crayon  wax.
__label__m _U  Ok  but  please  don't  be  rude  to  deaD  inside  xanax  moms
__label__m It  would  take  14.4  iPhone  7՚s  to  pay  the  average  cost  of  a  course  of  Aripiprazole  in  Nebraska  #trumpcare  #republicare
__label__m _U  The  sick  person,  has  had  morphine  from  time  to  time,  absolutely  hates  the  stuff.
__label__c oxycodone  is  great  lol  gonna  put  me  right  to  sleep
__label__a cigarettes  and  xanax  make  a  nigga  world  go  'round...  🙄  #truestory
__label__m germany  probably  took  adderall  before  this  game.
__label__c _U  lol  yeah  abilify  is  the  worst  out  of  everything  everyone  hates  it.  but  yeah  i  remember  my  first  time  being  on  risperdal  and  just,  not  caring  abt  anything  anymore  interspersed  w/  my  usual  episodes.  it  did  help  my  anxiety  i  guess  but  that's  about  it
__label__u Lyrica  momma  still  starting  mess  😂😂  #LHHH
__label__m i  feel  bad  because  i'm  still  not  100%  sure  what  exactly  methadone  is
__label__m Y’all  this  bitch  just  said  “have  you  ever  mixed  weed  mushrooms  and  Xanax  it’s  sooo  fun  “  😂😂  I’m  weak
__label__u lyrica  anderson's  voice  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
__label__m After  all  this  time  I  still  do  not  understand  why?  Why  does  it  matter  if  people  in  pain  recieve  treatment  for  pain.  I've  heard  the  od  excuse  but  nah...  I  was  on  3  types  of  benzos,  2  opiods  for  more  than  a  decade.  I  also  know  of  ppl  at  the  methadone  clinic  who  take  HUGE  amounts.
__label__a i  am  dying  please  save  me  from  my  job  i'm  exhausted  and  sick  and  tired  of  drinking  red  bull  and  popping  adderall
__label__m peelin  off  like  a  bandit....noddin  off  from  the  xanax  #theygonethinkiwonagrammy
__label__m _U  Who’d  they  poll?    A  group  of  lab  rats  on  xanax?
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Dan  -  methadone  and  meperidine  are  opioids,  not  opiates.  If  you're  going  to  sling  mud,  at  least  get  the  terminology  right.
__label__m That’s  why  Ryan  stupid  ass  wife  be  tryna  battle  her  so  bad.  Bitch  salty  as  shit  maci  whole  life  glowed  up  post  ryan  while  she  gotta  drive  him  back  &  forth  to  the  methadone  clinic
__label__c why  does  morphine  make  you  soo  itchy😩
__label__m _U  Massive  and  increasing  problem  in  the  Emergency  Department.  We’ve  seen  increasing  numbers  of  young  people  overdosing  on  Xanax,  having  obtained  it  from  the  internet.  Much  more  powerful  than  typical  street  benzodiazepines,  and  much  more  likely  to  be  deadly  in  overdose.  🚨⚠️
__label__m lyrica  commercials  are  just  sad.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  your  lieing  xanax  is  legit
__label__m sigmund  freud  recommended  cocaine  as  treatment  for  depression,  alcoholism,  and  morphine  addiction
__label__m I  took  a  Viagra  instead  of  a  Valium  #ThenTheFunStarted
__label__c Cannot  be  fuckin  arsed  for  how  monged  tramadol  get  you  🤕  just  want  to  get  rid  of  my  pain,  not  go  into  a  coma  thanks
__label__c my  body  says  sleep  but  adderall  says  not  this  week.
__label__u _U  ||  i'm  glad!  i  never  thought  i  would  ever  ship  lyrica  and  chika  together  but  i'm  glad  i  did!  it's  been  fun!
__label__u _U  _U  _U  _U  you  guys  can  sing  the  lyrica  and  i  can  play  backup  guitar  since  i  know  hotel  cali
__label__m You  can  always  tell  who's  off  the  Adderall  in  the  PCL  hahaha  wait  I  think  everyone  is...
__label__m _U  _U  _U  can  tell  you  what  morphine  addiction  is  like!
__label__c my  adderall  honestly  serves  it's  purpose  but  i  grind  my  teeth  terribly  when  i  take  it.  whyyyy  won't  it  ever  go  away?  it's  been  like  2  years.
__label__a i  just  got  like  8  assignments  done  at  the  office  in  like  two  hours.  ohhhh  the  wonders  of  adderall  ❤️
__label__c _U  i  guess  i  have  to  save  my  adderall  up  for  when  i  move  to  antarctica  though.
__label__m _U  _U  just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine  suddenly  im  a  fiend  and  you're  all  I  need
__label__a _U  My  brother  died  bc  of  drug  addiction.  His  Suboxone  cost  $600/mth.  He  started  selling  it  to  make  up  for  cost  and  then  bought  pills  or  heroin  to  keep  from  withdrawal.  That’s  not  encouraging.      You  have  to  bring  down  the  cost  of  medication!
__label__m I  can  see  that  homeless  person(s),  the  police  department  and  the  methadone  clinic  out  the  window  of  my  apartment.  Therefore  I  say  whatever  I  want.  You  alcoholic  people  with  you  50  year  old  body  look  pretty  foolish  trying  to  give  me  advice.  I'm  16-17  years  older  in  most  cases.
__label__m People  that  do  drugs  now  will  probably  end  up  in  the  methadone  line  in  10  years,  one  minute  you're  in  control  and  the  next  you're  gone
__label__c jesuuuuus  the  doctor  has  given  me  some  strong  stuff  to  take  for  my  neck..  diazepam  and  codeine  no  thanks🙅🏻😭😩
__label__m i  need  morphine  bye
__label__m _U  _U  Some  Tramadol  variations  can  be  prescribed  in  boxes  of  up  to  200  tablets,  stop  it  with  the  back  seat  quackery.
__label__m ._U  says  #ParklandStrong  =  trolls  who  "fantasize"  about  more  laws  against  "good,  law-abiding  citizens."  No,  sir,  we  fantasize  about  a  world  where  our  kids  aren't  shot  at  school,  and  where  it's  not  easier  to  get  #AssaultWeapons  than  a  prescription  for  #Adderall.
__label__m Nicotine  &  morphine  do  not  rhyme  with  heroin.
__label__m _U  I  am  so  happy  to  see  your  article  on  the  language  of  addiction.    As  a  buprenorphine  prescriber,  I  see  that  my  patients  experience  so  much  stigma  surrounding  their  treatment.    This  stigma  is  not  only  from  the  general  public  but  from  healthcare  providers/pharmacists
__label__m _U  #MurderOnWeasley  #unta  morfin  tramadol
__label__m _U  Didn't  recognize  you  with  a  suit  jacket  on,  but  then  I  read  what  you  wrote...yep,  the  crazy  Jim  from  congress!  I  don't  know  what  Rx  drugs  you're  taking,  but  I'd  add  Seroquel  at  bedtime.  Your  theories  are  shallow,  like  your  patriotism.
__label__m dear  nurse,  i  have  a  v  bad  headache.  oxycodone  might  help  idk  just  saying.  sincerely,  lindsey

__label__c I  have  been  in  incredible  pain  all  day.  Recovering  from  a  laparoscopic  appendectomy  hurts  WAY  WORSE  than  the  appendicitis.  Moves  between  9-10/10  without  morphine,  and  it  only  drops  to  7/10  with  morphine.  I  can't  eat.  I  can't  breathe.  I  feel  like  I'm  gonna  vomit.  This  is  awful.
__label__m poppin  cough  drops  like  i  should  be  poppin  adderall
__label__c I  haven’t  had  my  Risperidone  for  a  couple  of  days  and  my  head  is  swarming  with  unwanted  and  unpleasant  thoughts  lmao
__label__m OxyContin  and  heavy  syrup  got  me  looking  in  the  mirror  like  are  you  the  dope  fein  or  the  dope  boy
__label__a _U  No  lie  I  got  my  Dad  to  agree  to  come  to  Disney  with  us  for  the  first  time  when  he  was  doped  up  on  morphine  after  breaking  5  ribs  and  now  he  is  hooked.  Better  living  through  pharmaceuticals  😁
__label__c The  highs  and  lows  of  oxycodone  suck.  I'm  done  taking  this  crap  and  will  just  suck  up  the  pain.  I  can't  handle  super  chill  followed  by  short  bursts  of  panic  and  anxiety.  Too  weird  and  scary.
__label__m _U  you  can't  say  that,  it's  like  saying  you  did  xanax  with  neil  armstrong  in  space...  you  never  did  it,  you  can't  say  it

__label__m _U  Therapists,  pharmaceutical  industry  (XANAX),  alcohol  &  tobacco  industry,  masseuses,  and  more!  What  a  prezzzz!
__label__m _U  But  they’ll  proscribe  you  a  highly  addictive  medication  like  adderall  that  you’re  likely  to  get  hooked  on  causing  you  to  keep  paying  the  doctors  for  more.  It’s  like  they’re  turning  us  to  addicts  to  make  money.
__label__m _U  try  bleach  and  xanax  next  time
__label__m How  is  this  even  possible  to  get  like  900  of  those  PLUS  the  vics  and  tramadol..my  mind  is  blown  and  ive  seen  this  episode  before  lol

__label__m _U  _U  This  particular  conversation  hits  home  with  me,  considering  that  I  spent  my  high  school  years,  and  one  after,  with  parents  that  were  zombies  bc  of  methadone.    I  suspect  that  we  have  a  more  intimate,  and  therefore,  hardline  stance  against  easy  access.
__label__c _U  _U  I  never  had  a  weight  issue,  so  it  was  near  horrifiging  to  me.  Feel  much  better  already  all  way  around.      What  changed    ?    I  stopped  the  hydrocodone/opiods.    It  was  that  simple.

__label__m *mom  holding  a  glass  of  wine*  “wonder  how  I  would  feel  if  i  took  a  Xanax  right  now”

__label__a _U  help!  I  need  to  find  an  alternative  to  something  like  tramadol
__label__c i  have  a  serious  problem  with  forgetting  if  i  took  my  adderall  or  not.
__label__m the  slogan  for  vyvanse  and  adderall  should  be  "carpe  diem"
__label__m xanax,  the  phrase  'I  strictly  dab',  xanax,  velvet  dresses
__label__m _U  dear  norm,  dont  eat  too  much  xanax  sunday  night...or  do...i  will  enjoy  it  anyway.
__label__m _U  i  know  it's  a  last  resort  but  we  use  valium  for  our  dog  occasionally
__label__u Did  anyone  else  know  that  Meagan  Good  and  Lyrica  (from  LHHH)  were  cousins?
__label__c I’m  with  you  Shasta.    I  just  don’t  think  after  reading  about  it  that  it  would  be  a  good  drug  for  me.    I  think  that  because  I  have  been  on  opioids  long  term  that  the  bupe  in  suboxone  would  not  work  for  me.    Also  I  have  long  QT  syndrome  which  can  be  a  fatal  side  effect.    Not  for  me
__label__m "Adolescent  dreams  gave  to  adult  screams,  paranoid  that  I  won't  have  all  the  things  they  say  I  need."  Diazepam  by  Turnover

__label__c _U  i  took  5mg  of  diazepam  &  50mg  of  tramadol  on  top  of  10mg  baclofen  &  50mg  amitriptyline.  they're  kicking  in  now
__label__a _U  Just  hitting  my  first  valium  tablet  now
__label__m _U  I’m  thinking  Xanax  at  this  point  tbh
__label__a anyone  have  adderall  they  wanna  sell?
__label__m I  agree  _U!  Methadone  is  a  failure  of  the  drug  rehabilitation  system.  It  does  nothing  to  change  the  behavior  of  addicts.  #LivePD
__label__m I'm  honestly  getting  pissed  about  people  saying  peep  did  it  to  himself,  it  wasn't  him  the  dealer  gave  him  Two  Fentanyl  along  some  xanax.
__label__m As  illicit  Fentanyl  disguised  as  Percocet,  Vicodin,  Xanax,  Oxycontin  hit  the  US,  from  China,  legitimate  pain  patients  were  cut  off.  So  pill  mill  &  legitimate  pain  patients  seeking  relief.  I  think  this  was  a  plan.  Thin  the  herd.  State  mandates  talk  about  "human  patients"?
__label__c _U  Oh  I  hated  it!    I  had  that  during  my  C-section  with  my  son.    I  thought  I  was  flying  in  the  clouds  actually  dodging  birds  the  whole  time  and  trying  to  not  throw  up  which  is  what  most  women  do  on  morphine  when  they  are  having  a  C-Section.    😂
__label__c Diazepam:  am  I  up?  Whiskey:  Sorry  my  turn  tonight  Diazepam:  But  I  work  really  well  Whiskey:  I  just  think  he  wanted  to  mix  things  up  tonight  Diazepam:  Yeah  whatevs.  &lt;sulks&gt;
__label__m _U  IME  Gabapentin  is  the  one  that  fucks  people  up  the  worst  for  aphasia,  and  it's  the  favorite  for  doctors.  (It's  kinda  brutal  in  side  effects,  but  it's  almost  impossible  to  OD  on.)
__label__c Damn  it  I  have  the  shakes  again  from  the  morphine.  This  is  the  worst!  I’m  trying  my  best  not  to  get  too  down  about  this  but  it’s  hard.
__label__m I'm  finna  bout  to  start  growing  xanax  in  my  backyard  😤😤
__label__a xanax  till  i  dont  feel  the  molly,  pandora  on  phil  collins
__label__c _U  having  to  take  70  mg  of  vyvanse  aday  is  the  struggle
__label__m trust  in  me  trust  in  me  put  all  your  trust  in  me  you're  doin'  morphine
__label__a ive  been  eating  too  much  adderall  and  haven't  been  sleeping  or  eating  at  all,  i  feel  like  im  dying
__label__m _U  _U  _U  It  is  not  just  a  delusion  bt  actually  a  hallucination  caused  when  nut  size  brain  wallas  have  some  sasta  nasha..  Nasha  hi  karna  hai  toh,  have  some  high  quality  Charas  or  morphine  from  Afghan.
__label__c the  fact  that  ativan  may  have  cause  chris  cornell  to  end  his  own  life  is  scary.  i  take  that  for  anxiety.  i  rarely  take  it  but  stil
__label__m _U  its  usually  just  benzos  &  addies  but  tramadol  is  occasionally  from  them
__label__m nice  ppl,  the  phrase  'i  strictly  dab',  not  dust  off,  opiates,  xanax
__label__c i'm  seriously  gonna  toast  xanax  for  my  mental  and  emotional  stability  over  the  last  few  months.  👏🏽✨🍷✨👏🏽
__label__c In  the  midst  of  flare  up.  Freaking  tramadol  is  glorious  in  stopping  pain.  No  wonder  I'm  paranoid  about  getting  addicted  so  often  refuse  it
__label__c I’ve  been  on  Xanax  for  days,  starting  to  not  even  be  able  to  see  straight.  I  need  to  chill  for  real
__label__m _U  #alcoholawareness  JMF  Research  BC  Canada-Find  healthy  alternatives  to  Alcohol-  Thank  you  CT  Suboxone  for  sharing

__label__m pop  3  xanax  and  then  eat  your  asd
__label__a took  adderall  for  the  first  time  in  forever  and  i  think  i  just  cracked  the  code
__label__a _U  lol  i  was  living  off  coffee  and  adderall
__label__m Common  frustrations  when  determining  treatment  plan  for  patients  w/  opioid  addiction:  1.  How  will  this  person  manage  while  living  in  a  shelter?  2.  Why  can’t  I  prescribe  methadone  &  have  patient  pick  up  from  pharmacy?
__label__a _U  right  i  feel  you.  i  took  an  adderall  so  i  can  focus  on  painting  all  day  and  i've  been  up  since  3:30pm  tuesday.  😩😨
__label__m so  apparently  i'm  gonna  need  a  bottle  of  xanax  and    a  chaser  of  tequila  to  make  it  through  tonight's  episode??  #agentsofshield
__label__c i'm  dedicating  this  summer  to  convincing  my  parents  and  physicians  that  i  need  a  vyvanse  prescription  bc  i'm  literally  dead  w  out  it
__label__a _U  i  love  how  xanax  makes  me  feel  at  the  time.  but  even  after  taking  it  once,  i'll  almost  feel  like  i  need  it  the  day  after.  i  just..
__label__c _U  I  can’t  believe  your  language  on  here.    I’m  sure  your  grandparents  would  be  so  proud.  I  take  1  Xanax  a  day.  I’m  allowed  4.  My  script  lasts  me  50  days  for  30  pills,  and  I  have  the  government  report  to  back  it  up.  VERY  DISAPPOINTED  IN  YOU.  😥
__label__m percocet  and  codeine  please  don't  take  my  liiiiiiiiifeeeeee
__label__m _U  meh.  muscle  relaxers  &gt;  painkillers.  codeine  &gt;  any  oxycodone  derivative.  weed  &gt;  all.
__label__a _U  mate  i  think  you're  dealer  messed  up  your  order  with  meth  instead  of  morphine  .
__label__m _U  We're  a  reintegration  city.  Heroin  addicts  too.  2  methadone  clinics      Still  a  nice  town.  Constitutional  Carry  state
__label__a xanax  got  me  only  remembering  the  good  times  👆🏻
__label__m If  you  ever  leave  me,  baby..  Leave  some  morphine  at  my  door  to  realize  what  we  used  to  have  we  don't  have  it  anymore
__label__c There  needs  to  be  stricter  laws  around  methadone,  etc.  and  driving.    I  take  strong  opioids,  &  won't  drive  even  if  I  think  I  might  be  affected!  #TheProjectTV
__label__a i've  gotten  absolutely  no  sleep  this  past  week  but  it's  okay  cause  i'm  living  off  of  coffee  and  adderall  and  i  feel  great😄
__label__m _U  And  I  need  a  Valium.
__label__m _U  lots  of  morphine  and  ketamine  (!)  and  TV,  but  will  be  fine  :  )  Hopefully  out  by  the  end  of  the  week.  Hope  you’re  not  missing  fieldtrip  excitement  too  much!
__label__m _U  uh  oxycodone  i  think  !

__label__m thanks  to  the  rescheduling  if  hydrocodone  talwin  with  suboxone  is  the  new  standard.  that  is  awful  :(
__label__m just  read  that  oxycontin  has  been  approved  to  prescribe  to  children  as  young  as  11,  but  marijuana  upheld  as  a  schedule  1  drug...
__label__c vyvanse  has  literally  saved  my  life,  i  have  never  did  so  much  work,  my  parents  even  reward  me  with  things  now...  😋
__label__c _U  On  the  liquid  morphine  Barbara!  Good  stuff.  Did  you  get  any  when  you  were  being  pulled  apart?

__label__m _U  Got  psychotics?    Give  'em  Seroquel.
__label__c The  list  of  things  I  hate  about  Percocet  grows  by  the  day:  -Anti-Viagra  -Constipating  -Makes  you  sweat  like  a  Gatorade  commercial  -Its  name
__label__m white  girl  &gt;  percs  and  xanax
__label__c that's  a  fact  though  people  don't  realize  xanax  is  dope.  when  dope  heads  buy  dope  they  buy  xanax  too.  i  don't  wanna  be  affiliated  wit  dope.

__label__a it's  a  race  to  the  finish  me  line...  alcohol  in  first,  Valium  a  close  second
__label__a I  like  totally  can’t  sleep  so  I  took  four  times  my  Xanax  prescribed  dosage  🤭🎀😏
__label__m _U  2  weeks  seems  like  a  really  long  time  to  wait  right  now.  i  think  i'm  going  to  investigate  ativan  or  xanax.
__label__c MY  BODY  HAS  NOTHING  LEFT  TO  GIVE  I'LL  TAKE  LIQUID  MORPHINE  AT  THIS  POINT  WHYYYYYYYYYYyyyyy  how's  everyone  else's  Saturday
__label__m this  weasel  needs  oxycodone  hydrochloride!
__label__m the  us  is  4.6%  of  the  world's  population  and  accounts  for  99%  of  the  world's  hydrocodone  consumption.
__label__m you  feel  sad  or  angry?      well,  it's  time  to  use  drugs.      xanax,  vicodin,  adderall  &  more.
__label__c i  don't  really  like  adderall
__label__c _U  _U  Even  though  I've  now  been  dx  w/  #EDS  for  8  yrs,  I'm  still  having  to  argue  for  a  referral  to  be  genetically  tested  to  work  out  exactly  what  my  metabolic  issues  are.  I  process  a  4h  morphine  dose  in  under  2h,  for  a  start,  but  my  GP  insists  that's  habituation.  I  know  it's  NOT.
__label__a You  probably  just  think  im  being  edgy,  im  snorting  adderall  bitch  suck  this  cock  just  kidding  im  taking  20/mg  perscribed  like  mr.  doc  o  said.  yes  sir  take  ur  pills  go  to  work  DIE  TO  THE  SYSTEM!!!  FLORIDA  RETIREMENT  IS  THE  BEST  U  GET  LOL/

__label__c _U  yep  i've  still  got  some  diazepam  but  know  i'm  not  getting  any  more,really  hoping  propranolol  gets  considered  as  alternative
__label__m when  X  said,  “I  pop  the  pussy  like  an  adderall”  i  felt  that
__label__m loves  like  a  needle  full  of  methadone
__label__m everyone  is  being  really  aggressive  today.  can  we  all  just  relax  and  take  a  chill  pill?!  xanax  is  a  thing  guys.
__label__c seroquel  is  a  fucking  disaster
__label__m _U  _U  lmaoooo  i  think  theres  a  problem  with  every  team  there  involving    adderall
__label__c jk  i  didn't  even  take  adderall    for  that  one  :)
__label__u if  safaree  and  lyrica  really  smashed,  im  done.

__label__a i  have  one  tramadol  left  and  i'll  be  taking  it  tonight  before  i  get  shit  faced  🙃
__label__a i  can't  imagine  what  it's  like  to  be  addicted  to  something  worse.  i  was  only  on  xanax  for  like  half  a  year.  jesus.  addiction  is  scary

__label__c god  damn  i  need  a  pack  to  the  face  when  i'm  on  vyvanse
__label__a YOOOO  Went  into  a  2  day  coma  over  Xanax  so  you  can  call  me  lil  peep
__label__c I  love  taking  my  xanax  cause  it  makes  me  feel  like  a  rapper
__label__c _U  Sky  Factory  +  diverticulitis  +  morphine  =  it  hurts  to  laugh  on  so  many  levels.
__label__c had  to  stay  in  the  hospital  for  5hrs  today  just  for  the  to  torture  me  with  needles  and  morphine  and  i  still  have  pain  🙄😞
__label__a _U  bruh  xanax  killing  more  of  my  friends  then  the  hood  itself  these  kids  gettin  the  information
__label__m does  #futurehive  really  feel  as  though  they've  been  snubbed...or  is  delusion  a  side  effect  of  too  much  oxycodone  and  promethazine
__label__m Sir  RT  _U:  Xanax  Twitter  is  on  1  today
__label__c New  post  in  /r/OpiatesRecovery:  Anyone  had  problems  with  short  term  gabapentin  use?  Like  i  have  been  taking  it  nightly  to  sleep  at  about  16…
__label__m some  dude  on  tinder  just  asked  me  for  adderall  😂😂😂
__label__a i  need  to  find  adderall  by  tmrw  morning
__label__m _U  Ativan  so  I  don't  even  know  how  that  works
__label__c _U  Oh  geez,  I'm  sorry.  I  was  given  morphine  for  post  surgery  a  few  yrs  ago.  That  stuff  really  works.
__label__c An  adderall  I  took  this  morning  and  then  5  hours  of  mental  gymnastics  got  my  eyes  twitching  and  my  balls  tingling
__label__a selling  my  vyvanse  wholesale  again🙌🙌🙌
__label__c thank  gawd  for  my  adderall  😄
__label__m "uhm  do  you  guys  sell  xanax  or  just  those  travelers  advil?"
__label__a i'm  gonna  need  some  adderall  to  get  me  through  this  week
__label__c _U  Only  thing  that  works  for  me  is  Clonazepam.  But  in  truth,  you  need  to  see  a  therapist  and  discover  the  root  of  your  anxiety.
__label__c last  time  i  took  a  xanax  i  was  told  about  my  night  when  i  woke  up  from  a  12  hour  nap.
__label__m _U  I  was  literally  screaming  during  her  perf!  Patti  is  Evita,  now  and  forever!  I  need  a  valium....  :)
__label__c where  is  my  xanax  whewwwww😓
__label__m Breakout  groups  reporting  out...  research  question:  what  does  an  OB  prescribing  buprenorphine  need  to  be  successful?    #SMFM18
__label__m coca  cola  was  originally  sold  as  a  medicine  and  said  to  cure  headaches,  morphine  addiction,  and  impotence.
__label__m just  found  out  the  killer  whales  @  seaworld  were  on  heavy  doses  of  Valium  and  my  good  mood  has  been  ruined  :)))
__label__m mummy  needs  a  xanax  #tcmparty
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  See  if  the  doc  will  prescribe  you  tramadol.  They  don’t  like  to  but  if  you  tell  them  you  are  in  tremendous  pain  hopefully  they  will
__label__u Lyrica  baby  your  range  is  but  so  much.  Let  him  sign  these  other  girls
__label__m _U  _U  omg  i  wish  they'd  given  me  a  valium  butt  shot!  i  thought  i  was  having  a  heart  attack.
__label__m Fellow  anxious  peeps,  has  one  ever  taken  klonopin  daily  for  anxiety?  Thoughts?  I’m  looking  at  making  a  change  in  my  medication
__label__c Dear  Tramadol:  please  work  this  time.    Sincerely,  Everything  that  hurts.
__label__c where  would  i  be  without  my  hydrocodone
__label__m 😂😂😂😂  but  with  all  that  morphine  they  put  in  the  bloodstream  in  the  ICU  sincerely
__label__m u  played  the  viola  sophomore  year  stop  doing  xanax
__label__c _U  I  was  quite  happy  with  the  morphine  I  got  last  time  I  was  in  the  hospital.  Good  for  special  occasions,  but  not  an  everyday  kind  of  thing.
__label__a I  took  a  bar  and  a  half  then  forgot  where  I  put  the  other  half.  fuckin  Xanax  dude
__label__m I  been  taking  adderall  &  mixing  it  with  lean  ,  hoping  I  don’t  wake  up  out  my  sleep
__label__c I  haven't  slept  because  idk  why,  maybe  I  took  my  afternoon  Adderall  too  late,  so  don't  be  surprised  if  I  have  less  of  a  filter  than  usual  today
__label__m _U  &lt;  the  woman  and  guided  her  head  to  her  chest.  “You  should  sleep,”  she  offered,  knowing  the  morphine  in  her  system  would  make  that  task  easy.  Addison  pressed  a  kiss  to  the  top  of  Amelia’s  head,  sighing  into  her  hair.  Something  was  off  though,  &gt;
__label__c i'm  crashing  from  that  vyvanse  at  the  worst  time  lol
__label__a these  oxycodone  has  me  loopy.
__label__m if  i  have  to  pay  a  ridiculous  amount  for  my  migraine  tablets  i'm  gonna  fall  in  front  of  a  bus  and  hope  they  give  me  morphine
__label__m _U  Go  edible!  Cookies,  muffins  etc.  My  mom  is  terminal.  She  is  81.  They  tried  to  give  her  morphine!  Yes  you  have  to  find  a  dispensary,  but,  it  makes  100  percent  difference!
__label__c This  hydrocodone  will  be  my  best  friend  this  whole  week!
__label__m _U  Tramadol  is  the  most  popular  recreational  drug  in  Egypt.    It  can  be  used  as  currency.  Now  do  you  get  it?
__label__m What  if  Russ  was  secretly  the  biggest  pothead  Xanax  user  and  Coke  head  of  all  time  I'm  calling  cover  up?🤔    _U
__label__u _U  was  not  mad  at  A1  for  working  with  Keyshia  so  DO  NOT    COME  FOR  LYRICA  because  I  will    talk  bad  to  whoever  come  for  her  💯  😘🤣
__label__c Took  my  seroquel.  Now  it's  time  to  snuggle  down  with  classical  music  and  relax.  ♥  #RememberYourMeds  #TakeYoudMeds
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Narcotic  definition:    a  drug  (such  as  opium  or  morphine)  that  in  moderate  doses  dulls  the  senses,  relieves  pain,  and  induces  profound  sleep  but  in  excessive  doses  causes  stupor,  coma,  or  convulsions.
__label__m trump  looks  like  he's  on  a  shitload  of  xanax  right  now
__label__a i  want  adderall  but  i  also  want  xanax  at  the  same  time
__label__m i  can't  stand  type  a  people  outside  the  workplace/school.  if  you  don't  take  a  xanax  and  sit  the  fuck  down,  you  can't  control  everything.
__label__a i  took  adderall  last  night  and  on  my  life  the  only  time  i  stopped  talking  for  2  hours  straight  was  when  people  were  pouring  vodka  shots  from  a  syringe  into  my  mouth
__label__u yale  and  schlong  ftw  my  cousin  shira  gretblinguist  elder  to  lyrica  mctiernan  ftw
__label__m actually  that  might  just  be  adderall
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  she  had  too  much  valium  to  control  her  seizures  and  abnormal  brain  anomalies!
__label__m just  like  nicotine,  hairoween,  morphine
__label__m "percocet  an  codeine  please  don't  take  my  liiife"  -quavo
__label__a #washingtonsquarepark  i  once  took  some  adderall  and  stared  at  that  fountain  for  what  felt  like  3  decades.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  this  song  is  latterly  magic  ,  i  can’t  stop  listening  to  it  all  day  long  ,  just  like  Nicotine  heroin  morphine  🤯
__label__c My  hydrocodone  is  making  me  so  sick  to  my  stomach.  I’ve  barely  eaten  because  of  it.  But  I  don’t  have  an  appetite,  either.  I’m  eating  something  when  I  take  the  meds,  but  I  can’t  stomach  a  lot.
__label__m train  conversations:  i  want  to  do  valium  and  then  drop  acid
__label__m hate  when  people  be  like  “oh  your  name  zan  like  the  drug”  no!  xanax  isn't  the  same  as  zan'drea.  😒
__label__m i  rmb  when  my  dad  was  on  high  dosage  of  morphine  he  couldn't  recognize  me  too  and  let  me  tell  you  that  was  the  most  painful  thing  ever.
__label__m _U  _U  give  me  geodon,  vyvanse  and  xanax  and  i'm  good.
__label__m _U  _U  well,  seeing  as  how  randi  has  her  adderall  ridden  hands  all  over  it,  probably  not
__label__c So  I  have  an  appointment  with  my  PCP  Thursday,  it'll  be  the  first  time  seeing  him  since  I  overdosed.  Now  I'll  have  to  talk  with  him  and  attempt  to  rebuild  the  trust  so  I  can  keep  my  scripts.  A  bit  nervous,  but  Klonopin  helps  a  ton  with  that.  Meh...
__label__a thnx  vyvanse  for  having  me  stay  up  all  night  wrapping  everyone's  christmas  presents
__label__m "brittney  go  catch  that  dog,  it's  running  all  over  my  room"  ...  ight  abi  i  feel  u  with  that  morphine
__label__c To  all  you  OxyContin  abusers!  Screw  you!  I  have  trouble  getting  mine  because  of  abusers  like  you.  I'm  paralyzed  and  in  excruciating  pain!  FU
__label__m *karen  gets  ketchup  on  her  white  pants*  “i’m  gonna  need  some  oxycontin  for  these”    ITS  OXYCLEAN  MOM
__label__m Anyone  had  good  or  bad  experiences  with  neurontin?
__label__a and  i  will  od  on  coffee  and  my  adderall  lol
__label__m some  people  need  to  take  adderall  so  they  can  just  focus  on  themselves  and  not  on  my  business
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Tramadol  is  a  synthetic  opiate  similar  to  Codeine
__label__m I  wish  Alex  retires  at  85  &  does  his  part  in  heroically  saving  Social  Sec.    He  then  can  look  forward  to  pleasure  of  going  on  oxycodone  for  arthritis  of  his  joints  &  spine,  &  having  his  knees  &  hips  replaced  &  spending  months  in  recoveries.    At  age  85  he  won't  enjoy  retirement.
__label__m if  i  was  a  pill  popper.  id  need  a  xanax  right  now.
__label__c adderall  had  me  watching  protein  synthesis  &  dna  youtube  videos  for  2  hours  😐

__label__m and  on  the  third  day  adderall  fell  from  heaven  and  all  the  college  kids  rejoiced
__label__m _U  _U  What  will  dreamgirls  do  when  _U  is  re-elected  to  a  2nd  term?  Ask  for  an  increase  for  the  Alprazolam,  jump  out  a  window  or  move  to  CAN?  Have  you  noticed  Democrats  NEVER  threaten  to  move  MEX,  the  racists  they  really  are?
__label__m Have  migraines?You  probably  have  OCD.This  causes  a  total  eclipse  of  the  heart.Try  Abilify
__label__m _U  Get  on  the  melatonin/diazepam/benzoids  lol
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Thank  you  Eleanor,  I  googled  cause  of  death  Prince  and  came  up  with  article  from  2016  stating  he  had  a  bottle  of  hydrocodone  that  was  actually  illicit  fentanyl  formed  in  to  what  appeared  to  be  hydrocodone.  Thanks  again
__label__a the  oxycontin  and  the  syrup  got  me  lookin  in  the  mirror  like  "is  you  a  dope  fiend  or  a  dopeboy?"
__label__m _U  it  will  better  society  by  mixing  neighborhoods.  "ever  since  that  methadone  clinic  moved  in  i've  been  saving  60%  on  my  commute."

__label__m im  so  nervous  i  need  50  xanax  and  a  horse  tranquilizer  and  to  be  carried  everywhere  in  a  stretcher  and  constantly  sang  to  like  a  little  baby
__label__m my  head.    I’ve  never  been  the  same,  in  fact  it  has  gotten  worse  now  that  she  has  started  chemo.  She  is  on  morphine  24  hours  a  day  to  deal
__label__a i  took  an  extra  adderall  to  work  on  making  my  resume  look  nice  but  now  i  cannot  give  a  fuck  im  gonna  go  read  wikipedia
__label__m I  just  saw  the  worst  story  on  the  news.    Apparently  addicts  are  purposely  injuring  their  pets,  taking  them  to  the  vet,  and  using  this  incident  to  take  the  Tramadol  for  themself.  😠😡
__label__c i  am  like  inbox  zero,  but  also  i  would  rather  take  a  klonopin  tonight.
__label__m You  don’t  think  the  powers  that  be  didnt  put  an  equation  of  “trauma-saturated,  poverty  stricken  black  kids”  and  “Xanax”  together?
__label__m my  prof  talked  about  how  adderall  is  bad  &  i  thought  about  something  funny  &  we  made  eye  contact  &  i  laughed  &  now  she  thinks  i  do  adderall
__label__m _U  Artie  was  SO  sick  he  couldn't  call  his  employer...doubt  it.  Pretty  sure  when  he  did  the  SMACK  either  he  took  his  normal  amount  and  OD'd  or  it  didn't  mix  with  the  suboxone.  How  many  hospital  stays  is  this  in  year,  anyone  have  a  calculator  ?
__label__m _U  Oh  this  is  great  news.  Klonopin  made  R’s  anxiety  issues  so  much  better.  I  hope  it  helps  !
__label__a took  an  adderall  so  i  can  write  a  paper  that's  due  tomorrow  but  instead  im  holding  a  9  hour  conversation  with  _U  #stillgoing
__label__c Had  a  dream  and  my  dad  said  "Joel  get  your  shit  together".  No  more  Xanax  💯
__label__c _U  i  take  seroquel  rn  for  sleep  which  works  but  im  trying  to  get  off  that  if  the  trazadone  helps
__label__c _U  I  had  a  2  teeth  pulled  about  2  years  ago.  It  was  only  $75/tooth.  Hub  had  2  wisdom  teeth  pulled  last  year.  $180  total.  Half  priced  dental.  They  didn’t  accept  our  insurance.  Excellent  care,  but  no  gas.  I  had  to  have  a  Valium  though  and  nearly  had  a  panic  attack.  Good  luck!
__label__m #WhatTheWorldReallyNeeds  is  more  Xanax.  Damn.
__label__c _U  i  typed  this  while  frantically  rummaging  around  my  apartment  bc  i  lost  my  adderall  scripts  and  took  my  last  pill  today  and  have  NO  CLUE  where  they  are
__label__c getting  a  library  card,  license  and  an  adderall  prescription  in  philly  is  so  difficult  for  no  reason
__label__c _U  seroquel  doesn’t  work  for  me  anymore  😩.  i’m  on  it  now  but  i’m  hoping  to  be  switched  to  something  else  when  i  go  to  my  next  psychiatrist  appointment
__label__a just  drank  a  large  iced  coffee  after  taking  my  vyvanse  and  i'm  feeling  goooood
__label__m _U  _U  Same  with  the  meds.  Hydrocodone  Nasty  stuff.

__label__m zyprexa  for  the  longest  time  didn't  have  any  generic  form  because  lilly  miller  refused  to  consider  letting  the  $$$  go.  $500  avr  for  30  pills
__label__m so  proud  to  say  i’ve  never  popped  a  Xanax  and  i  never  will
__label__m _U  didn't  this  come  up  in  pre-op  appointment?  it  should.  they  can  give  you  valium  to  take  before  you  even  leave  for  hospital.
__label__m _U  Have  you  seen  how  small  the  cars  have  to  be  for  this  thing  to  work  properly.  Anyone  slightly  claustrophobic  ot  over  6  feet  tall  is  going  to  have  to  take  a  Valium  to  ride  this  comfortably.
__label__c _U  what  are  you  taking?  maybe  you  need  a  long-term  management  like  a  patch?  i've  been  on  gabapentin  &gt;  a  month  &  it  is  helping
__label__u I’m  sorry,  lyrica  is  just  um..  maybe  I’m  insensitive.
__label__c tramadol  is  not  cutting  it  anymore..
__label__m _U  _U  take  tramadol  for  tooth  ache,  it  will  also  help  you  sleep  with  5mg  valium
__label__m _U  The  family  properly  never  donate  to  Museum  of  the  Fur  Trade  because  fake  news  the  activity  of  trapping  receives  from  HSUS  and  others;  but  I  stand  with  the  Sackler  family  to  donate  Harvard  Museum.

__label__m _U  Be  super  careful  with  Xanax..  it’s  killing  a  lot  of  people
__label__c I  have  all  of  the  side  effects  caused  by  Lyrica  because  of  Tennessee  football

__label__m _U  yea  it  oxycodone
__label__c _U  A  doctor  (eventually  arrested,  tried,  and  convicted  of  Medicare  fraud!)  put  me  on  Methadone  and  then  kicked  me  to  the  curb!  I  wound  up  in  the  hospital  in  severe  drug  withdrawal!

__label__m 74  days  ago  I  stopped  smoking  but  think  I'm  going  to  be  a  chain  smoking  valium  popping  alcoholic  come  4.30  today  -  my  nerves  are  shattered  already!  C'mon  Rangers  🔴⚪🔵
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  Exactly!  Bupe  &  methadone  suck  at  pain  control  for  most  &  those  who  cannot  tolerate  or  react  poorly  are  screwed.  Just  more  medical  handcuffs  for  people.  Inhumane,  illogical,  &  quite  frankly  just  bad  medicine!
__label__c _U  Vyvanse  is  an  appetite  suppressant,  and  when  I  was  in  the  Uk  I  ..  well  got  my  schedule  messed  up  so  I'm  paying  for  it  now
__label__m i  really  just  can't  wrap  my  head  around  people  taking  xanax  for  fun  while  some  have  to  take  it  to  get  through  the  day.
__label__c _U  Man  the  hydrocodone  gave  me  extreme  hiccups  so  I  had  to  double  up  on  the  ice  cream
__label__u Lyrica  and  Ginny  wow  actual  girlfriends
__label__u _U  Dude  always  liked  your  music-  saw  u  in  the  Morphine  Doc  &  feel  you  are  carrying  on  that    Boston  Vibe  out  there  IN  LA  THANX
__label__c it's  official..  i  need  a  prescription  for  adderall
__label__m When  Josh  Homme  said  “nicotine,  valium,  vicodin,  marijuana,  ecstasy  and  alcohol”  yo  I  felt  that  shit  hun  xx
__label__m i  ultimately  just  want  a  xanax  prescription
__label__m _U  And  overwhelmingly  only  offered  bupe  or  methadone.
__label__u So  Lyrica  came  up  there  just  to  give  him  so  head  ?  #LHHH
__label__m _U  Oxycodone.  A  nonaddictive  super  strong  painkiller  sounds  too  good  to  be  true,  because  it  is.
__label__c shld  of  taken  adderall  to  help  me  years  ago
__label__a _U  why  not  just  take  vyvanse  it's  like  super  aderol  and  my  friend  keep  buying  my  scripts
__label__m _U  my  sister  after  2  abortion  of  6  weeks  is  taken  zyprexa  and  antidepressant
__label__c Morphine  doesn't  work  for  jack  SHIT  on  me    HARDER,  I  NEED  HARDER  DRUGS
__label__c klonopin  has  saved  my  life
__label__m _U  _U  yeah--the  add  diagnosis  came  in  gr  1.  off  adderall  now  and  i  think  that  drug  was  like  poison  to  him.
__label__c fuck  adderall  all  the  shit  does  is  make  me  depressed  af
__label__m _U  They're  mild  sedatives,  probably  something  similar  to  valium  aka  Diazepam.
__label__m _U  You  work  in  Tesco,  not  Harrod's...  you've  told  me  all  about  Methadone  Mondays!  😂😂😂  Shame  though...  would've  been  nice  to  watch  you  fall  asleep  drunk  on  my  couch  again!  😂😂😂  xx
__label__c i  have  got  to  stop  taking  vyvanse  toward  the  en  of  the  day  on  school  days
__label__m she  told  me  lean  over  and  pop  a  oxycontin
__label__m _U  Or  a  case  of  the  bourbon  mouth  or  the  OxyContin  mouth  or  th  stroke  mouth
__label__c when  i  take  adderall  my  handwriting  gets  significantly  better
__label__m _U  _U  Breach  of  the  misuse  of  drugs  act  as  Well?  As  tramadol  is  scheduled  and  a  class  C?
__label__m _U  _U    ...my  doctor  literally  said  she  thought  i  was  i  needed  26  ativan  at  that  moment
__label__m u  know  ur  neighbor  is  on  adderall  when  she's  taking  notes  in  a  notebook  about  the  syllabus  that's  next  to  her  #cracked
__label__c LRT  the  replies  are  a  dumpster  fire  of  ableist  bullshit.  Like  straight  up,  I’m  the  trifecta,  sick,  disabled,  and  poor,  and  my  life  is  actually  pretty  amazing.  Like  I’m  up  right  now  feeling  like  shit  from  coming  off  risperdal  and  my  life  is  still  awesome.
__label__a this  hydrocodone  got  a  nigga  bout  gone.  swear  it  just  took  me  a  good  30  seconds  to  type  the  work  "gone".
__label__m You  smoke  weed,  and  add  up  Tramadol  with  coke.  Few  minutes  later,  You  hear  chooboi,  chooboi,  In  your  head,  It’s  a  set  up  my  brother.  The  moment  you  respond  'Yie'!,  U  are  mad    😂😂😂  Gudnite  Fams  🌑🌚
__label__a _U    I’m  a  opiate  addict  thinking  of  going  on  suboxone  myself  I’m  wondering  if  your  still  on  it  and  recommend  it  or  not  ?
__label__c This  hydrocodone  boutta  have  me  slump  again
__label__c 3  hours  of  sleep  but  like  it’s  okay  because,  adderall.
__label__m elohim  -the  wave  -xanax  -fuck  your  money
__label__c lying  in  the  grass  with  my  pup  was  more  calming  than  my  lorazepam
__label__m _U  adderall  is  for  people  who  need  adderall
__label__m xanax  spelled  backwards  is  racecar  😱😱😱
__label__a hey  _U    i  got  3  adderall
__label__m i  need  a  freaking  xanax  before  i  go  into  walmart.  this  place  is  a  shit  show.
__label__a my  parents  hid  the  alcohol  so  i'm  just  gonna  take  a  lorazepam
__label__m I  went  to  mars  and  bought  some  xanax  bars  to  go  to  sleep,  i  left  Future  in  Pluto  cause  that  boy  was  toooo  geeked
__label__a i  don't  feel  ready  to  quit  doing  drugs  and  alcohol  so  early  nor  do  i  want  to  take  abilify  again  so  i'm  just  a  huge  mess  right  now
__label__m _U  #highhillary  needs  to  get  back  to  her  sweet  morphine  drip  why  cant  huma  deal  with  the  presidential  stuff??
__label__m Regarding  #Egypt  #Tramadol  #Travel  #Legal  Are  lists  of  substances  or  medicines  not  permitted  available  to  clients  of  travel  companies/airlines?
__label__a so  i've  been  excited  about  #oitnb  coming  on  at  midnight  cst.  now  thats  changed  to  3am.  the  fuck  _U  !  i  took  an  adderall  for  nothing?!
__label__c diazepam  fucks  me  up  man  it  fucks  me  up
__label__c my  stomach  and  shoulder  hurt  like  hell.  i  can't  wait  for  this  oxycodone  to  kick  in.
__label__m _U  If  anybody  needs  Adderall  it's  you#Focus  #PayAttentionLongerThan2Minutes
__label__m _U  I  think  that  the  Republicans  needed  Xanax  or  some  Prozac  today!  lol  😂😄😅
__label__m i  take  quaaludes  10-15  times  a  day,  adderall  to  stay  focused,  xanax  to  take  the  edge  off,  cocaine  to  wake  me  back  up  again  and  morphine
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  We  see  addicts  who  claim  sobriety  but  have  been  on  methadone  for  10  years!    SMH
__label__m _U  yes  i  know  of  the  drug  abilify  what  about  it
__label__m i  think  they  put  morphine  in  this  hash
__label__c I  went  to  the  pharmacy  to  pick  up  Klonopin  and  a  large  roll  of  duct  tape  so  I  decided  to  look  “less  suspicious”  by  also  buying  a  handful  of  hideous  discounted  hair  bands.  A+
__label__m My  biggest  fear  is  if  I  let  you  go,  you’ll  come  and  get  me  in  my  sleep.  #sandman  #morphine  #bluest
__label__m Xanax  is  no  joke.  Just  one  time  is  all  it  takes  to  become  hooked.  And  that  shit  will  ruin  your  life.
__label__m been  awake  all  night,  perhaps  i  need  diazepam
__label__m literally  zero  pharmacies  carry  adderall
__label__m _U  and  the  valium  mate  😲😲😲
__label__m _U  Glenn  still  doing  so  much  blow  that  he  doesn’t  know  WHO  to  be  pissed  off  at  this  morning.  Take  a  Valium  and  go  to  bed,  willya?
__label__m why  won't  my  doctors  prescribe  me  morphine  for  tomorrow's  procedure?  #thursdaythoughts
__label__m i  feel  like  we  should  start  a  gofundme  campaign  to  send  xanax  and  zoloft  to  riverdale.
__label__m _U  Dear  Mam  please  help  no  oxycodone  available  in  Ocala  FL  seniors  on  maintenance  cancer  patients  etc  need  legitimate  drug  plan  needs  revamp  Thank  You  Ken  Roberts
__label__m _U  These  poor  kids  and  people  😕  how  can  we  keep  them  from  the  medicine  that  works.  But  we  will  push  OxyContin  on  everyone  for  10+  years  and  that  cool  😡  lying  about  it’s  safety.  They  just  want  you  to  buy  their  drugs!
__label__a 2  adderall  i'm  rollin  !!!
__label__c She  needs  to  stop  ringing  me  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and  expecting  me  to  “forget”  I’m  disabled  while  I  help  her  out  of  her  crapulence!!  I’ve  come  home  and  am  now  taking  oxycodone  to  deal  with  the  pain!
__label__m _U  did  u  try  to  take  a  valium  shot  i  heard  it  helps  in  extreme  cases  🙁
__label__m _U  _U  I  don't  know  but  apparently  doggy  xanax  is  much  stronger  than  human  xanax
__label__m peeling  off  like  a  band  aid,  noddin'  off  on  the  xanax
__label__u I'M  SO  TIRED  OF  THIS  BIRD  NEST  ON  LYRICA'S  HEAD
__label__c _U  _U  ahh  ok.  from  personal  experience,  gabapentin  less  well  tolerated  compared  to  pregabalin  though!
__label__c 2  years  ago  I  was  in  a  jail  cell  contemplating  suicide,  on  xanax  after  I  had  punched  a  cop  and  got  a  gun  charge.  Now  I  got  a  full  time  job  making  $14  an  hour.  Life  changes  and  anyone  who  says  people  can’t  change,  just  haven’t  experienced  it  for  themselves.  Life’s  what  u  make  it.
__label__a Mom  :  why  would  you  want  a  Xanax  if  you're  gonna  drink  monster  energy?    Me  :  I'mma  get  crossfaded
__label__c this  oxycodone  isn't  doing  its  job
__label__m what  is  subsidised?  paracet  and  one  opiate.  but  not  the  long-term  frontline  meds  for  #chronicpain  like  cymbalta  (lilly)  and  lyrica  (pfizer).
__label__m _U  The  only  way  people  could  possibly  like  their  music  is  from  valium  in  the  water  supply.  Buy  my  water  filters
__label__m _U  seems  unfair  seeing  show  people  who  need  adderall  lose  focus.
__label__a My  mom  keeps  asking  me  if  I  need  to  go  to  rehab  for  drinking  lmao  good  thing  I  lived  in  a  different  state  when  I  had  a  Xanax  problem  and  also  when  I  had  a  coke  problem  and  also  when  I  couldn’t  leave  the  house  w/o  getting  high  first
__label__m just  thinking  aloud  oshogbo  weed  +  tramadol  +  codeine  +  hot  sun  +  terry  g  music  =  ?
__label__m Honestly  the  correct  punctuation  on  this  is  “Xanax.”  It  was  far  more  sincere
__label__m the  knights  lose  1  game  and  v*gas  fans  lose  their  god  damn  minds.  relax.  pop  a  valium.  oh  yeah  and  GG!
__label__m Suboxone  is  weird  af
__label__m _U  if  he's  going  to  try  to  rehabilitate  dr  gur  he  better  be  handing  out  xanax  to  the  jurors!
__label__c going  on  a  new  psych  drug  is  super  scary.  i  always  fret  about  it.  seroquel  is  not  a  permanent  gig  for  me,  due  to  my  pre-diabetes  +  #bipolar
__label__m "oh,  you're  from  sweden?  i  love  that  swedish  beer  with  valium  in  it!  really  tasty!"  uh..  beer  with  valium?  sounds  like  a  bad  mix..
__label__m _U  Gabapentin  is  not  a  pain  medication  and  has  strange  side  effects.  Ditto  Tramadol.
__label__c Miracle  too  is  crying😫😫  I  really  need  a  dose  of  valium  to  aid  sleep  tonight😭😭  #BBNaija
__label__m which  one  of  these  candidates  will  make  oxycodone  available  over  the  counter?
__label__m if  methadone  is  free  to  drug  addicts  because  they  have  a  dasease  then  why  isnt  chemo  fee  to  cancer  pantients  for  there  deaseas
__label__m _U  _U  _U  I  am  sure  the  tramadol  and  codeine  is  working  in  your  system.  By  2019  your  kind  will  either  be  in  jail  or  in  a  political  rehab.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  don't  forget  adderall  mal  :-)
__label__m if  u  ever  leave  me  baby,  then  leave  some  morphine  at  my  door
__label__m _U  Yeah,  and  it  seems  that  fentanyl  is  showing  up  sometimes  now  in  pressed  Xanax,  although  idk  how  frequently
__label__m _U  _U  _U  There,  there  Mr.  Exaggeration.  Try  a  cup  of  tea  and  a  lie  down.  You  may  need  to  pop  a  Valium  as  well.
__label__m When  ever  I  go  to  the  suburbs  I  hate  these  old  white  bitches  that  try  look  like  DEY  from  the  80s  n  shit  bitch  you  50  wit  a  Valium  addiction
__label__c gluten  free.  dairy  free.  fat  free.  carb  free.  sugar  free.  calorie  free.  i  love  the  xanax  diet!
__label__m oxycontin  have  me  laying  soft  cotton  when  i  sleep    ?
__label__m _U  You  should  hop  on  a  plane  and  go  there  if  it’s  so  great.  When  you  return,  someone  will  have  your  aripiprazole  dose  ready  for  you.
__label__m You  can  tell  I  never  have  drugs  because  I  called  it  "a  pile  of  drugs"...Like  you  have  to  step  over  Xanax  on  your  driveway.
__label__m “@bxxmp:  i  think  i  need  pills  for  my  anger  or  a  punching  bag  in  my  room”  they  dont  make  anger  management  pills  lol  they  got  xanax  and  prozac
__label__m im  stressed  to  the  point  of  being  nauseous/sick  and  nOw  they  remind  me  that  we  have  xanax,
__label__u somebody  ft  me  ,  lyrica  &  breisha  💁
__label__c Leaving  xanax  behind  in  2018.  3  NyQuil  and  a  good  nights  sleep  is  what  I’m  flexing
__label__m you  really  need  to  take  a  xanax  and  shove  it  up  your  ass
__label__m TRUMP  means    Terminally  Ripping  Unreal  Methadone  Propeller
__label__u I  didn’t  know  Lyrica’s  ass  was  that  big  though  👀
__label__a breaking:  vyvanse  and  adderal  now  for  sale  at  the  berry  cafe
__label__c _U  _U  Had  to  give  up  a  lot  of  info  to  get  hydrocodone  after  my  oral  surgery
__label__m _U  he's  there  with  his  diazepam  pen  to  tell  her  to  keep  talking  if  her  earpiece  suddenly  malfunctions  &  she  goes  into  seizures.
__label__m _U  is  that  really  trump  or  a  robot?    a  trained  monkey?    his  handlers  need  to  decrease  the  valium  dose.
__label__m “Pwedeng...Ironman  nalang...si  Robert  Downey,  Jr.  ang  idol  ko  e”    “Okay...Ironman...balikan  kita  mamaya.  Magpahinga  ka  na  muna.”  Dei  said  as  she  adjusted  the  IV  drip  after  adding  the  prescribed  dose  of  morphine  to  Richard’s  IV  drip.    “Salamat  ulit”    #ALDUBAlwaysOurBibis
__label__m i  just  got  a  missed  call  for  a  random  number  THEY  LEFT  A  VOICEMAIL  ASKING  TO  SWAP  A  PHONE  FOR  VALIUM
__label__a Just  now  remembered  I  got  two  test  tomorrow  #Vyvanse  #Adderall
__label__c oxycontin  is  a  great  drug  if  you  wanna  be  sad  and  constipated
__label__c _U  and  i  meant  broadcast  not  announcement!!  public  service  broadcast!!!    god  i  need  to  get  off  oxycodone  😬
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  LOOK  UP  Morphine.  Read  and  learn.
__label__c they  gave  me  "quetiapine  fumarate"  as  a  substitue  for  seroquel  (the  pharmacy)  that  doesn't  even  sound  similar
__label__m pulmonary  edema:  treatment  lmnop:  lasix  morphine  nitrates  (ntg)  oxygen  position  (upright  vs.  flat)
__label__a someone  at  wmu  wanna  bring  me  an  adderall  to  the  library
__label__a _U  _U  nah  i  can  do  it.  get  some  adderall  in  me  and  i'll  glitter  bomb  the  fuck  out  of  the  world
__label__u Pam  and  Lyrica  got  the  same  hairstyle  #LHHH
__label__m i  think  they  put  an  adderall  in  my  shake
__label__c I  need  to  take  an  Ativan  before  I  go  to  bed  jfc
__label__m beginning  to  think  pregabalin  might  actually  break  the  doh.  what  a  palaver.
__label__a i  juh  wanna  roll  a  fat  blunt  and  sprinkle  some  xanax  on  the  top  and  just  chill  😩  dumb  ass  fucking  probation  got  me  fucked  up😤
__label__c _U  i  did  adderall  when  i  was  5  -.-    grow  up  lex
__label__c woke  up  this  morning,my  neck  was  acheing,it  just  got  worse!my  doc  put  me  on  oxycodone  again  and  hoped  it  would  help!need  the  surgery  now!!!
__label__m _U  i'm  concerned  with  domestic  terrorists  shooting  up  schools.    oxycontin  kills  more  than  these  terrorists  you  speak  of.
__label__c I'm  so  happy  to  be  off  Seroquel  omg  ty  god
__label__m Querem  me  fazer  feliz?  ME  MANDEM  XANAX
__label__m Just  like,  nicotine,  heroine,  morphine  #ReggaetonLento  #BestRemix  #iHeartAwards
__label__c best  decision  i  ever  made.    would  be  dead  by  now,if  id  kept  on  that  dose  of  morphine.  bc  theyd  have  HAD  to  increase  it,  (why  im  on  ir  oxy5-10  now)  bc  you  get  used  to  it,and  it  quits  working.  addiction  isnt  the  same  as  chemically  dependent,either.  big  doses  cause  that  too.  it  shut
__label__c noon.    time  for  lunch  and  a  xanax  already!    got  a  laughing  crow  across  the  street.    i  swear  he's  laughing  at  me.  —  feeling  thoughtful
__label__m if  you  have  every  person  in  the  world  just  one  adderall  all  in  the  same  day,  we  could  fix  every  issue.
__label__m _U  Your  tweets  are  in  English  but  I  detect  a  slight  accent  of  Xanax
__label__c so,  i'm  supposed  to  take  this  ativan  a  full  hour  before  my  dentist  appointment  tomorrow.      you've  been  warned.
__label__c *finals  week  indicator*    having  to  go  to  three  different  pharmacies  to  get  a  vyvanse  prescription  filled
__label__m E  be  like  say  this  Croatia  team  drink  tramadol  with  redbull  during  break  ohh.  Where  all  this  energy  come  from?😑  #ENGCRO
__label__m It  goes  further:  senior  military  officials  told  us  that  stashes  of  tramadol  recovered  from  Islamist  militants  like  Boko  Haram  often  outnumber  bullets  found  in  their  hideouts.
__label__c valium  was  not  a  good  idea.
__label__m Someone  Should  Please  Alert  _U  That  Betway  is  killing  the  young  boys  in  this  Worldcup  Era  more  than  Tramadol  😂😂😂😂😂😂
__label__c started  on  a  higher  dose  of  lyrica  and  it  seems  to  be  working  a  bit  better
__label__a 3  valiums  n  some  codeine  ,  i  practically  roofied  myself
__label__c ain't  been  to  sleep  yet  fucking  adderall
__label__c The  first  time  in  6  months  I'm  feeling    that  I'm  not  owned  by  withdrawals.  I  hesitate  to  say  this  because  the  battle  is  still  not  over.  I  am  at  slightly  under  2mg  Valium.  Thanks!      #Benzodiazepine  #Withdrawal  #Pfizer  Inc.  _U    #Teva  _U  #Roche  _U  #Mylan  _U
__label__m _U  Then  id  advise  you  to  replace  ritalin  with  amphetamines🌩️
__label__m seriously  bitch  take  a  xanax  and  chill  tf  out
__label__m Is  Lyrica®  a  drug  that  makes  you  better  at  music?  If  so,  can  the  majority  of  current  artists  have  some?
__label__m #Sacklers  should  find  treatment  for  addicts.  #PrescriptionDrug  abuse  #Oxycontin
__label__a not  feeling  so  guilty  since  it's  just  xanax
__label__m _U  (  the  OxyContin  helps  a  little  too,  lol  )
__label__a binged  three  times  already  today  so  strict  adderall  and  coke  diet  starting  now
__label__m _U  _U  yep  it  looks  like  it  was  pain  killers  probably  something  in  the  hydrocodone  (oxycontin)  family.
__label__m _U  Keep  the  morphine  feed!
__label__m get  yo  fine  self  to  a  doctor  for  a  morphine  shot  in  the  bum.  used  to  work  a  treat  for  me!
__label__c i'm  on  seroquel  at  the  moment  and  a  lot  of  it  and  lithium
__label__m so  tired  of  these  fidget  spinners.    in  my  day  if  you  were  fidgety  you  just  took  a  valium  to  offset  the  coke.
__label__m Xanax  is  the  new  black.
__label__m I’m  a  mess.  Plz  send  help  and  a  Xanax  thank  youuuu
__label__m _U  _U  _U  more  evidence  of  benefit  than  morphine  !
__label__m _U  _U  also:  the  change  of  pharma  OxyContin  to  Oxyneo  has  also  played  a  role  in  people  switching  to  street  opioids
__label__c _U  on  morphine  patches  and  pills  😠  money  worries  are  receding  at  last  tho'  so  all  ok  really!  how's  things  with  you?  manchester?  bf?
__label__a me:mom  you've  a  herniated  disc  in  ur  back,  take  1  of  my  neurontin  an  drink  coffee  mum:  they  make  me  drowsy  be:that's  what  the  coffee  is  for
__label__c Wow  shit  really  does  start  popping  off  in  the  morning  when  I  wake  up  from  Valium  lmao
__label__m "isn't  xanax  that  thing  for  allergies?"
__label__c _U  i've  got  2  days  of  morphine  so  hoping  that'll  help!!  slept  surprisingly  well  last  night  so  see  how  it  carries  on!
__label__m vyvanse  to  gain  control  of  your  crazy  mind.
__label__m _U  Honestly?  I'd  probably  go  for  Fentanyl  and  an  antihistamine  for  the  rash.  2.5mg  of  oxycodone  isn't  going  to  touch  your  pain.
__label__m _U  _U  Any  stats  would  be  clearer  with  a  larger  population.  Oxycontin  is  semi  synthetic  and  Fentanyl  is  completely  synthetic.    Much  of  this  comes  from  China,  I  believe,  and  Afghani  poppy  residue  is  probably  found  more  often  in  SE  Asia  where  it's  less  trouble  to  peddle.
__label__u Get  methadone  mick  aff  ma  telly
__label__a Anybody  have  some  adderall?  I'm  trying  to  set  a  goal  to  read  the  Book  of  Mormon  within  24  hours🙏🏻
__label__m _U  Ground  control  to  Tuff  Ghost  Don’t  forget  to  go  to  the  doctor  tomorrow  and  get  a  new  Klonopin  scrip  Try  to  talk  him  into  upping  the  dose  This  is  ground  control  to  Tuff  Ghost
__label__c hydrocodone  kicking  in  ,  know  I’m  a  about  to  slumped
__label__m wellllll  i  guess  i'll  work  out  and  go  for  an  early  morning  run...  did  someone  slip  me  some  adderall  or  something??  #tooawake
__label__a Super  depressed  atm  bc  i  just  ate  chocolate  meth  during  the  xanax  lifestyle  atm  that  cant  be  satisfied,  very  frustrating
__label__a I  can’t  find  my  anxiety  pills  so  I  took  a  lorazepam
__label__c it  looks  like  a  xanax  night  for  me.
__label__c Doctors  appt  went  ok.  Prescribed  some  Lyrica  and  referred  me  to  a  neurologist.  Doc  (me  also)  thinks  it  has  to  do  with  a  neck  disc.
__label__c i’ve  taken  it  off  for  the  night  and  i’m  taking  some  tramadol  and  putting  an  ice  pack  on  my  back.
__label__a so  good  to  be  home  just  one  thing  missing  but  not  for  long  morphine  got  me  high  as  a  kite  so  peeps  n  hopefully  beta  4  tomorrow  night  😘💑💗
__label__m adderall  for  u  niggas  tryna  pass  college  finals
__label__a going  over  the  texts  _U  sent  whilst  high  on  morphine  is  my  new  favourite  thing
__label__c _U  I  am,  Klonopin  is  daily.
__label__m Graham  acts  like  he’s  on  Valium  😂  #emmerdale
__label__c _U  I  took  Lyrica  for  a  /very/  short  time  for  nerve  pain.  Three  or  so  days,  then  a  local  ER  doctor  said  no  more,  the  allergic  reaction  was  trying  to  kill  me.    Everyone  responds  differently  to  drugs  indeed!  I  know  people  who  swear  by  it  &  it's  weaker  sibling  Gabapentin.
__label__m _U  that  Valium  update  has  just  booted  me  out  my  page,  I  get  a  fatal  error  and  no  login  options  now.
__label__m _U  it  feels  like  adderall  haha
__label__m _U  I  will  tell  her  you  said  thank  you  and  she  also  said  try  not  to  take  any  pain  killers  in  less  you  absolutely  need  to  because  my  mom  took  a  Oxycodone    and  she  went  to  sleep  and  she  woke  up  having  hallucinations  that  her  whole  knee  was  cut  off  so  try  to  stay  away  from  them  🙏
__label__c _U  _U  In  the  hospital  they  will  have  me  on  morphine  and  will  send  me  home  with  oxycodone.
__label__m _U  _U  It’s  a  plant,  methadone  handed  out  like  candy  though
__label__m supposed  to  start  this  shit  at  10am.  it's  2pm  and  they  just  raised  his  morphine  up.  still  on  vent.
__label__c Also;  im  gonna  kms  soon  due  to  lack  of  aprazolam/xanax/klonopin/clonazepam
__label__m damn  i  didn't  know  my  mom  was  on  oxycontin  😂😂😂
__label__m my  brain:  don't  say  anything  weird  my  mouth:  i'm  a  communist  and  the  scene  where  elliot  throws  up  the  adderall  and  then  eats  it  again  is  hot
__label__a never  having  adderall  and  pre  workout  in  the  same  day  again  😷
__label__a wish  i  had  morphine  to  floss  rn.  or  something  stronger  ;)  ;)
__label__m Just  like  nicotine,  heroin,  morphine  Suddenly,  I’m  a  fiend  and  you’re  all  I  need.                                                                                                #NeverBeTheSame  _U
__label__c like  wtf  hydrocodone  didnt  kill  the  pain  or  make  me  drowsy  so  now  im  in  pain  and  up  at  1  am
__label__m We  need  to  address  the  cause  of  youth  dependency  on  drug.  In  ask  these  noise,  no  one  has  yet  seen  the  effect  of  education  in  eradicating  such  scourge.  We  all  shout  BAN  CODEINE  as  if  tramadol,  volume  5,gum,  Omo  mixture  are  not  easily  available.
__label__m xanax  is  for  losers,  idc.
__label__c Was  always  prescribed  with  great  reluctance,  and  the  current  crisis  in  opioid  deaths  (mostly  due  to  non-prescribed  illegal  drugs)  makes  it  really  hard  to  get.  If  you're  able  to  get  Oxycodone  prescribed,  it  did  wonders  for  me  and  is  safer  than  fentanyl.  But  it  can  be  addictive.
__label__m y  is  everyone  on  adderall  this  time-o'  year?
__label__m idea:  pez  dispenser  that  gives  out  xanax
__label__c I  don't  see  how  people  can  get  hooked  onto  this  Hydrocodone  mess.  It  makes  me  nauseous  every  time  I  drink  it  🤢.  It's  terrible!
__label__m _U  Low  dose  so  can’t  see  why  they’re  being  uppety.  If  it  was  10mg  Diazepam  I  could  understand
__label__a really  craving  tramadol  rn
__label__m shey  ko  bawe  je  sha?  "_U:  don't  mix  valium  up  with  viagra"
__label__c _U  Valium  n  something  else.  Nuh  coughing  will  kill  me  coz  went  through  stomach.  Be  few  weeks  before  I  have  a  cone
__label__m _U  this  one  doesn't  require  a  full  article.  the  answer  is  simple:  valium  and  vodka
__label__a I  used  to  take  so  much  xanax,  coke,  Molly  and  almost  had  a  heart  attack  then  I  met  Adrianna  and  she  flipped  my  life  around  and  saved  me  from  my  old  self  I  love  that  women  with  all  I  got  ❤️
__label__c was  only  screaming  ~internally~  during  my  surgery  consultation  appt  yet  they  still  managed  to  write  me  a  valium  prescription  without  a  word
__label__c these  fuckers  wont  get  me  any  more  morphine  ima  bomb  this  place
__label__a _U  _U  2  corona  extras,  and  a  hydrocodone  to  get  me  feeling  loose
__label__m toyota  executive  arrested  for  smuggling  oxycodone  :(
__label__c He  gave  out  20  extra  fentanyl  patches  at  one  point.  Entire  bottles  of  the  wrong  medication.  Today  I  had  to  correct  my  Suboxone  because  it  was  4  pills  short.    He  even  gave  me  a  whole  bottle  of  Suboxone  that  I  wasn't  supposed  to  get  with  the  wrong  label.
__label__a Does  anyone  have  a  klonopin  plug.  Asking  for  a  twitterless  friend  lol
__label__m How  can  I  convince  my  doctor  I  need  a  Benzodiazepine?  Because  I  really  do,  I  can’t  go  out  in  public  without  freaking  out  and  I  get  super  paranoid  at  home.  I  really  want  Ativan,  but  I’m  worried  my  psychiatrist  won’t  give  me  any.  What  do  I  do?
__label__a if  some-one  could  hook  me  up  with  a  morphine  drip  i'd  be  very  grateful!  😄
__label__m Mfs  was  doing  Xanax  to  look  cool,  now  I  feel  like  a  lot  of  people  are  so  called  “quitting”  Xanax  to  look  cool  because  they  realized  how  uncool  that  shit  was...  fuck  being  cool  😂
__label__u Lyrica  been  getting  bold  as  fuck  with  her  mouth  like  girl...
__label__c vyvanse  what  have  you  done  to  me
__label__c i  guess  the  xanax  is  stopping  a  lot  of  the  emotions.
__label__c adderall  got  me  writing  two  10  page  papers,  preparing  for  this  weekend,  analyzing  the  world  &  wondering  where  i'll  be  6157  days  from  now
__label__m life  of  a  college  kid:  "i'm  about  to  take  an  adderall  and  drink  a  beer  with  it."  -_U
__label__m _U  _U  _U  Oh  no!  I  didn’t  know  that.  Saw  the  mention  of  morphine  &  assumed  terminal  illness.  How  awful  &  shocking  for  his  family,  partner,  friends  &  colleagues.
__label__m _U  Do  you  know  what  else?  We  have  a  policy  that  if  a  pt  on  pca  leaves  the  unit  the  pca  must  be  stopped  and  discarded.  Pt  will  get  a  new  cassette/  bag  upon  return  to  the  unit.  I  don’t  think  it  is  strictly  enforced  though.  Imagine  wasting  a  100ml  bag  of  Morphine.
__label__a _U  I  once  tried  adderall  on  college  while  working  an  all-nighter  with  some  brothers  and  once  it  kicked  in  I  sat  down  and  said  'Gentlemen,  I  think  I  can  figure  out  my  entire  life  right  now.'  I  didn't  of  course.
__label__u _U  The  Harry  doll  looks  like  Prince  Valium  from  Spaceballs!  Hahahha
__label__m _U  The  UNLV  kids  popped  their  adderall's  2  hrs  ago  and  havent  been  able  to  play,  the  entire  campus  is  spotless.
__label__m High  heels  on  my  neck  when  you're  dancing.  she  sleep  on  a  valium,  she  dream  about  nothing.  i  will  take  care  of  her,  i  would  do  anything
__label__a _U  Do  it.  I’ll  come  dribble  over  your  chat  while  I’m  soaped  our  on  Valium.
__label__a U  know  ya  back  f##ked  when  4  tramadol  doesn't  help  it
__label__m all  yall  taking  xanax  &  shit  thinkin  yall  tight  movin  round  like  a  zombie  you  gon  be  mad  when  yo  ass  don't  wake  back  up  😴😂
__label__c _U  on  codeine  ,  still  got  naproxen  and  some  diazepam  left.  she  said  i  shouldnt  have  been  prescribed  as  much  as  i  did.  i  ain't  (2£
__label__m _U  _U  Give  Gabapentin  in  Rehab  then  they  abuse  it  and  laugh  about  it  because  rehab  give  them  free  drugs  to  abuse
__label__c _U  _U  They  also  police  the  poor.  I  couldn’t  get  my  oxycodone  prescription  filled  at  a  Walgreens  after  my  major  surgery.  They  claim  it’s  too  dangerous  in  my  PoC  neighborhood.  The  Walgreens  is  right  across  from  NYPDs  90th  precinct  BTW
__label__m I  am  at  the  dentist  and  wishing  I'd  taken  valium  or  something  because  I  am  panicky!
__label__c Something  I  learned  the  last  time  I  was  at  the  hospital  I  have  a  very  high  tolerance  for  both  pain  and  the  morphine  to  numb  the  pain...  even  when  it’s  injected  directly  to  the  place  smh
__label__m _U  watch  out  vintage  xanax....  he  will  smash  your  thumb  to  bits
__label__m _U  Throw  a  Valium  in  😀
__label__m _U  and  i  can't  trust  a  man  who  takes  vicodin,  valium,  and  adderall  all  while  heavily  drinking.  guess  we  just  can't  trust  each  other
__label__c My  nurse  shows  up  an  hour  and  a  half  late  for  my  morphine  then  says  there's  no  schedule  when  I  tell  him  he's  late
__label__m my  bro  has  been  taking  my  acne  meds  thinking  it  was  my  adderall  this  whole  time.  should've  told  him  it  was  birth  control
__label__c Managed  to  sleep  for  a  whole  hour  w/o  xanax  🙁
__label__c _U  DEPRESSANTS  IS  IN  MY  GENE  POOL  AND  NOBODY  SHOULD  HAVE  LOW  SELF  ESTEEM  ABOUT  NEEDING  PROZAC.  THEY  THOUGHT  I  HAD  A.D.H.D.  AS  A  CHILD.  I  TOOK  ADDERRAL  BUT  I  DIDN'T  FIND  IT  PARTICULARLY  ADDICTIVE.  IT  HAD  A  "DUH,"  EFFECT  ON  ME.  I  DON'T  TAKE  IT  ANYMORE.  I  WAS  JUST  BEING  A  KID
__label__a not  sure  if  that  was  too  much  tramadol  for  a  school  play  or  not  enough  tramadol    either  way  it  was  'special'
__label__c me:  i  was  only  3  whole  days  late  changing  out  my  morphine  patch  this  morning  why  am  i  still  in  withdrawal  smh  my  body:  i  swear  to  f  ucking  god
__label__c idk  if  it's  this  adderall  or  these  lyrics  that  are  making  me  so  emotional  rn..  probably  both.
__label__m ohhhh  xanax  loser  okay  yeah  you're  good
__label__m _U  He's  faded  off  a  adderall
__label__m Why  have  I  only  just  realised  that  Morphine  sounds  like  a  sophisticated  woman's  name?
__label__m _U  if  t.smith  and  cook  are  a  go  clemson  fans  might  want  to  have  some  xanax  near  by..and  i  would  go  with  smag  in  this  game..
__label__m _U  hey,  3rd  frade,  just  looked  at  your  feed-looks  like  you  lost  your  valium
__label__c medication  //  when  u  forget  to  take  ur  adderall  and  u  literally  crash  and  burn
__label__a past  experience  says  if  i  take  extra  seroquel  i'll  still  wake  up  on  time  so
__label__m i  either  just  dreamt  about  dying  from  an  oxycontin  overdose  or  actually  did  and  being  tweet'd  about  by  my  80%  opacity  ghost
__label__m _U  Jip.  The  fact  that  people  think  others  willingly  get  into  addiction  is  shocking.  Even  drugs  like  adderall  and  xanax  is  a  big  problem  in  the  US  because  one  is  just  legal  meth  that  keeps  celebrities  thin  and  wall  street  going  and  the  other  is  a  bullet  in  the  gun  of  alcohol
__label__c _U  i  am  going  to  need  some  xanax  after  tweeting  you  so  many  times  #callmejake
__label__m My  late  gogo  from  my  dad’s  side  was  on  Gabapentin  tablets  but  she  used  to  say  pass  me  my  GAVISCON  pills  please😂😂😂😂😂        mhsrip  🙏
__label__m Spending  the  night  in  a  hospital  and  they  won’t  give  me  any  drugs  even  though  I  have  insurance!  They  said  that  since  my  dad  is  the  one  having  the  hip  replacement  I  can’t  get  into  the  morphine  drip  🤡🤕😪🤤💧
__label__m Go  to  desk,  say  tramadol  not  working,  they  write  a  note  and  will  pass  to  nurse  when  they  can????
__label__m Have  trouble  focusing?Yes?You  suffer  from  Alcohol  addiction.This  causes  masturbation.Try  Xanax
__label__a The  missus  told  me  to  talk  to  the  kids  about  drugs,  so  I  told  them  that  faking  a  back  injury  is  a  great  way  to  get  some  Oxycontin
__label__m _U  suboxone  drs  by  going  to  the  suboxone  site-but  not  all  of  them  are  involved  with  inpatient-
__label__a i  need  some  adderall  so  i  can  do  all  the  homework  i  was  suppose  to  do  over  break
__label__u _U  lyrica  if  she  up
__label__a nowadays  i  find  it  impossible  to  sleep  without  whisky,  tramadol  or  valium;  so  spend  the  time  looking  at  old  pictures  of  danzig  and  the  cats.
__label__c In  a  time  of  fake  and  shit  friends,  Xanax  is  my  solace  😪
__label__c “_U:  adderall  had  me  remembering  my  myspace  password”  i  wish  you  could  remember  yours  _U
__label__m My  ex  mate  has  been  winning  Valium  2mg  representing  6  senility  these  days,  he  was  habituated  them  when  he  knock  a  scratchy  connection,  nowadays  he,due  south  contingent  them.  The  scratchy  darn  elongate!  I  conceive  everybody  is  altered  ,  any  humanity  hawthorn  on  no...
__label__m _U  _U  From  the  guy  who  is  the  founder  of  the  OxyContin  brigade.
__label__m _U  and  the  methadone  clinics  will  be  standing  by  to  kill  the  ones  affected  when  money  can  no  longer  be  made  on  street  drugs.
__label__m _U  _U  this  ain’t  abt  u  morphine  u  should  be  the  one  who  moves
__label__m Or  does  _U  honestly  not  care  that  this  dude  is  literally  bouncing  in  his  chair  because  he’s  on  so  much  adderall.  #ninjashyper
__label__m Pens  it  is...  time  for  Thames  Water  to  pumps  diazepam  and  fentanyl  into  the  network.
__label__m _U  _U  Yes,  they  do  also  use  morphine.  For  the  same  level  of  pain  relief  and  sedation,  it  causes  more  hallucination  in  my  experience.
__label__m I'm  here  for  9  more  hours.  Send  help.  Adderall.  Red  Bull.  Jesus.  Something.  Please.
__label__m how's  your  xanax  princess?
__label__c i  wanna  take  xanax  but  idk  where  it  is
__label__m _U  _U  what  xanax  means?
__label__a I  just  found  15  pills  of  vyvanse  and  an  old  pipe  of  mine  it's  a  good  day  already  😌
__label__m Meanwhile,  _U  opens  ._U  #opioids  hearing  on  #fentanyl  –  "an  incredibly  powerful  drugs.  100  times  more  toxic  than  morphine.  Used  to  tranquilize  large  animals."  #OpioidCrisis  #OpioidEpidemic  #opioids  #FDA  #NIH  #CDC  #pharma  #biotech
__label__m _U  realistically  this  is  where  you  would  need  a  xanax  the  most  also  i  am  your  666th  follower
__label__c really  think  every  girl  deserves  to  get  a  3-7  day  course  of  anti  depressants  or  diazepam  during  time  of  the  month  cause  i  can't  cope
__label__m Also;  morphine  is  fuckin  tite
__label__m "acid  and  adderall  don't  mix  "💀dead.
__label__m _U  Valium  Laura.  And  a  book.
__label__a caseys  dad  just  said  "here's  a  adderall  do  you  want  a  shot  of  fireball  with  it  today's  my  birthday"
__label__c adderall  had  me  like  i  love  doing  school  work
__label__c _U  yeah  I  also  took  some  Klonopin  and  idk  what  made  me  so  sleepy  but  I've  been.  Shlump
__label__u Lyrica  to  dramatic!  Why  can’t  y’all  work  on  ya  album  and  other  ppl  albums  and  make  money  together🙄  #lhhh
__label__m _U  Stock  up  on  the  tramadol  I  think  😂😂
__label__a Need  adderall  pls  help
__label__m 500mg  seroquel  will  put  a  horse  down  ,  and  they  prescribe  it  to  kids
__label__m _U  Thank  you  Emily.  My  son  was  poisoned  with  #risperdal  during  seven  years.  I  cannot  forget  that.  Take  care  of  yourself!
__label__m There  is  no  bright  line  between  opioid  dependence  and  opioid  addiction  -  _U  Some  patients  are  able  to  taper  without  difficultly,  others  struggle.    Issues  to  consider:  relapse,  street  opioid  seeking,  liable  if  remain  on  high  doses,  role  of  suboxone  #CanadianPain18
__label__c _U  Needed  that  Ativan  I  took  on  Mon  for  the  MRI,  lol.
__label__m I  need  a  valium...or  even  better  an  adavand
__label__m lofi  hip  hop  is  better  than  xanax  tbh
__label__u #LHHH  come  on....get  the  wig  budget  for  Pam  and  Lyrica  together  lol
__label__m That  was  a  REAL  messy  feud.  Sharon  said  Courtney  was  the  first  person  to  give  her  son  OxyContin  which  caused  his  drug  addiction.  Then  Courtney  called  Sharon  a  liar  and  said  she’d  never  give  drugs  to  a  teenager.
__label__m however  by  2002  it  seemed  that  a  different  regime  was  in  place;  diff  hospital  Stratheden,  Risperidone  coervicely  given,  risky  mixed  gender  ward  so  didn't  resist  drugging,  didn't  want  to  be  too  drugged  up  in  dormitory  overlooked  by  male  patients  in  single  rooms  wore  clothes  in  bed
__label__a finally!  a  new  vyvanse  script!!  good  will  hunting  time.
__label__m _U  Veteran's  Administration    Clinics  &  I  guess  Hospitals  and  Labs  have  been  checking  routine  Urine  Samples  for  Hydrocodone  drug  usage.
__label__m i  did  this  drive  without  adderall  and  goddamn  i'm  tired  😭
__label__m _U  _U  the  tunnel  vision  is  how  my  seizures  start.  i’d  suggest  not  taking  tramadol  anymore.
__label__a (drugs)    i  took  an  adderall  and  drank  half  a  neuro  and  i  feel  like  i  am  burning
__label__m kesian  seh  the  eugene  stress  because  he's  lacking  morphine  and  syrettes  and  he  doesn't  even  have  scissors  lmao
__label__c _U  ache  all  over,  so  cold,  can't  feel  my  toes,  cough,  head  hurts...  literally  need  morphine
__label__u _U  I  bet  it  was  lyrica  time  soon  as  you  walked  through  the  door.
__label__m "Her  #spirit,  meek  as  a  dove.  Her  #Kiss,  sedative  as  Valium.  Her  #hug,  cosy  as  a  home.    That  is  the  #woman  I'll  call  my  own"  -  Fancee
__label__m _U  I  detest,  truly  hate  this  administration  and  every  action  they  take  to  screw  us  over  in  favor  of  fast  and  huge  profits  for  their  corporate  buddies.  And  the  Trump  voters  cheer  as  if  all  high  on  Oxycontin
__label__m lmfao  they  said  the  baby  made  from  xanax  😂😂😂😂😂😂
__label__m _U  _U  because  you  have  heroine  nicotine  and  morphine  in  your  blood  veins  and  head  when  you’re  in  performance  mode
__label__a I  found  a  single  50mg  tramadol  in  one  of  my  old  seroquel  bottles  Thank  you  Jesus  and  also  past  me
__label__m tastes  like  cigarettes  and  alcohol;  up  all  night  on  adderall
__label__c i  need  a  xanax  before  i  punch  the  fuck  out  of  something
__label__m #prince  overdose  lottery  choices.    heroin.  morphine. or  oxycodone  place  your  bets.
__label__m Curious  do  you  know  anything  about  medicine  or  pharmacology?  I’m  have  a  rare  incurable  disease  and  your  very  existence  in  a  medical  system  I’ve  been  forced  to  be  a  part  of  offends  me.  Keeps  your  filthy  Suboxone  synthetic  heroin  away  from  incurables.  You’re  an  dangerous  idiot!
__label__m _U  purdue  exec's  were  found  guilty  for  suppressing  info  on  the  addictive  properties  of  oxycontin  related  to  time  release  properties.
__label__m _U  _U  Donny  b'y  they  has  to  check  there  throat  for  tampons  before  they  give  them  there  methadone.  If  not  they  sell  the  tampons  full  of  methadone.  True  story
__label__c three  cheers  for  xanax

__label__m _U  _U  _U  I’m  sure  we’ve  all  heard  about  how  heroin  was  made  as  a  “less  addictive”  cough  suppressant  than  morphine

__label__c xanax  has  my  soul  🤘🏻
__label__c when  you  haven't  had  adderall  in  your  system  in  like  5  days  then  you  take  one  at  7am  and  are  freakishly  athletically  active  at  9:30pm  &gt;
__label__m _U  _U  y'all  prolly  gone  forget  this  tonight  cause  of  them  xanax  anyways  yall  good
__label__m morphine  ...  god  of  reading  bedsit  poetry.
__label__m !-normally  get  arrested  for,  but  cops  ignore  a  lot  of  shit  and  the  government  locally  spends  millions  on  handouts  and  free  methadone  clinics
__label__m KEEP  CALM  and  Lorazepam  por  si  acaso.
__label__c adderall  is  gay  all  it  does  is  piss  me  off
__label__m _U  _U  Fucking  hell  lydian  take  a  Valium
__label__a _U  yeah.  i  feel  like  i’d  be  a  lot  more  productive  if  i  had  some  adderall  and  a  clear  understanding  of  the  goal  and  what  i  need  to  do,  but  as  of  now  i  just  smack  my  hands  on  my  keyboard  and  pray  it  works.
__label__m people  who  do  meth  get  skinny  and  hyper.  people  who  do  methadone  get  fat  and  sleepy.  #stuffilearnfromjosh
__label__m Should  start  with  forcing  methadone  clinics  to  stop  taking  new  clients,  and  then  make  them  show  results  4  getting  off.
__label__c picking  up  my  klonopins,  ambien  and  vyvanse  all  in  one  fell  swoop.  go  me!
__label__u Lyrica  need  to  put  a  visual  for  “unhealthy”  and  give  it  the  single  treatment  that  it  deserves.  I  see  that  doing  well  for  her.
__label__a I  wait  around  weeks  to  get  adderall  and  everytime  my  plus  re  up  im  ALWAYS  broke.  FUCK  MY  LIFE
__label__m vicki  looks  high  on  xanax  #rhocreunion
__label__m My  doctor  told  me  stop  He  gave  me  something  to  pop  Might  mix  it  up  with  some  adderall    And  wait  till  I  get  to  the  top
__label__m honestly  though,  if  we  pumped  adderall  into  the  water  supply  for  like,  one  week,  we'd  have  everything  in  america  fixed  by  new  years
__label__c _U  ANd  this  is  why  I  demanded  a  xanax  prescription.
__label__a yo  hook  me  up  with  some  adderall  so  i  can  be  better  at  video  games
__label__m _U  haha,  codeine  per  chance?  or  morphine  maybe?!
__label__m _U  Yeah,  it  wasn’t  a  surprise  because  he  was  on  form  nine  days  earlier  in  hospital  on  morphine  (I  think  they’d  run  out  of  skunk)
__label__c Ev:  I'm  really  a  mess  right  now.    I  can  barely  find  the  energy  to  function,  much  less  the  will  power.    And  thanks  to  abilify  I  can  barely  hear  the  others,  but  I  need  to  take  that  to  have  much  chance  of  functioning  anyway.
__label__c valium  for  dinner,  i  think.
__label__c _U  close  your  eyes  during  and  eat  food  when  taking  the  pain  meds.  i  ending  up  getting  sick  from  hydrocodone  so  be  careful!

__label__m _U  suboxone  is  a  scheduled  drug,  perhaps  you  are  confusing  with  narcan?
__label__m _U  _U  Reread  it.  it  says  ILLICIT  fentanyl  and  tramadol
__label__c Testing  out  the  Ativan  tonight  for  my  flight  tomorrow.  Ugh  anxiety  problems.
__label__a walkin  down  arlington  at  10pm  with  a  handful  of  morphine
__label__c I  use  klonopin  now.    Not  every  day  but  I  spiral  w/out  it  sometimes  due  to  MAOIs  keeping  my  DA  levels  ☝️    I  haven't  bothered  touching  illegal  narcs  in  two  years  after  Nov  16.    Lifes  too  good  without  them.    Shame  it  took  25  years  of  abuse  but  we  get  there  in  our  own  time.
__label__m _U  y  u  take  Tramadol  or  wossop  😈😈
__label__m _U  #TeflonDon  please  stop  #Gaslighting.    I  know  that  truth  is  a  very  difficult  concept  for  you  to  embrace  but  you  are  destroying  the  foundations  of  our  democracy.    Go  have  a  nice  cup  of  tea  and  a  Xanax.
__label__m _U  there  working  for  the  whole  establishment  and  there  monitary  methadone  pumping.
__label__m When  the  person  that  means  a  lot  to  you  leaves  you.  It  just  hurts  so  much,  like  an  ice  pick  being  stabbed  right  through  your  chest,  the  pain  just  wont  leave.  I  need  a  lot  of  morphine  pls
__label__m Coming  out  of  the  MRI  like  -  PLEASE  PLEASE  say  it's  a    huge  brain  tumor  because  morphine.  #ihavehadamigrainefor2months
__label__m In  this  study,  individuals  on  long  lasting  naltrexone  saw  a  65%  relapse  rate  after  21  days.  Individuals  on  buprenorphine  saw  a  57%  rate  of  relapse.  The  highest  portion  was  those  who  were  never  induced  on  medication.
__label__a im  waiting  for  my  mans  (vyvanse)  to  get  here  (kick  in)  so  we  can  fuck  (do  homework)
__label__m _U  You  need  some  Xanax  Thas  gone  clear  that  anxiety  right  up  😂😂😂😂
__label__c _U  Same.  I've  been  taking  tramadol  on  &  off  for  years  &  have  had  to  make  an  appointment  every  time  I  need  it  refilled
__label__a I  feel  sad  when  I  hear  the  name  tramadol,  I  lost  a  friend  last  month  he  was  just  20  years.#EndTramadolAbusewithGHOne
__label__m _U  Maybe  its  time  india  started  looking  into  medical  marijuana,  which  is  a  better  alternative.  Restrictions  on  morphine  makes  some  sense  because  it  is  highly  addictive,  but  of  course  those  who  need  should  be  given  access.
__label__m _U  _U  Sharap  there!  Tramadol  plus  codiene
__label__m _U  _U  Pantoprazol,  kaolin  and  morphine  and/or  doctor!!!  I  had  it  for  a  week  two  weeks  ago,  turned  out  to  be  tummy  flu  building  up,  my  best  friends  for  a  week  were  toilet  and  a  bucket.  Llap,  please  get  checked!!!
__label__c _U  I  had  some  weapons  grade  diazepam  once,  that  was  pretty  lovely
__label__u Why  Lyrica  have  to  go  so  hard  with  Feenin?  😩
__label__m _U  I  misread  your  tweet  and  thought  it  said  Klonopin  Koala
__label__m I  think  everyone  should  watch  The  Adderall  Diaries.  Amazing  film.  💯  recommended  dose  of  realness.
__label__m _U  dude  adderall  sucks  lol
__label__c okay  mom  my  mouth  hurts  again  you  can  stop  hiding  the  hydrocodone  now  🙄
__label__m _U  I  would  be  concerned  4  methadone  being  given  to  pregnant  women  because  it  is  extremely  addictive.
__label__a adderall  is  my  very  best  friend
__label__c I'm  getting  angry.  Gabapentin  is  used  by  people  who  desperately  need  it,  like  me.  The  f***ing  opioid  crisis  means  no  codeine  for  serious  coughs,  but  gabapentin  works  great.  I  am  so  angry  at  the  people  who  abuse  it  &  government  who  punishes  decent  people  who  actually  need  the  meds
__label__m fuck  a  heavy  dose  of  reality  i  need  a  low  dose  of  zyprexa
__label__c i  forgot  how  much  i  hated  adderall  because  i  cant  sleep
__label__m _U  he  probably  also  has  oily  skin  and  isn't  eating  well/enough.  tw////do  u  think  he's  the  type  to  use  adderall  during  finals
__label__a _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  40  right  here  -  just  lost  20  lbs  of  fat  -  adderall  and  working  out  -  amazing
__label__c but  people  like  myself  who  are  on  prescriptions  like  xanax  are  fucking  psychos.  okay  bitch.  Okay
__label__m yo  bro  does  my  finger  smell  like  morphine?

__label__m In  clinical  trials,  cerebrovascular  adverse  events  (CVAE  e.g.,  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attack),  including  fatalities,  were  reported.  There  was  a  3-fold  increase  in  CVAE  in  patients  treated  with  olanzapine  compared  to  patients  treated  with  placebo  (1.3%  vs.  0.4%,  respectively)
__label__a _U  one  of  my  brothers  is  addicted  to  suboxone  &  it  terrifies  me  that  it  could  kill  him  my  whole  family  is  on  drugs  or  alcoholics
__label__c _U  yeah  they  gave  me  seroquel  because  i  couldn't  sleep  once  when  i  was  in  a  hospital  &it  really  did  work.
__label__m _U  Depends  on  the  opioid.  Tramadol  certainly  possible.  Codeine  much  less  so.  Buprenorphine  no.
__label__a _U  oh  god  😂  let  me  decide  if  i  want  to  use  this  adderall  for  work  and  i'll  let  you  know  in  a  few  minutes
__label__m _U  _U  You  seem  upset  Joey.  Might  I  suggest  a  good  stiff  drink  and  perhaps  a  diazepam  to  calm  down?
__label__c This  just  in:  ativan  is  fun,  even  when  you're  getting  your  eyes  cut  open  with  lasers
__label__m curious  as  to  who  supplies  your  adderall  _U
__label__m is  it  the  cocaine  or  xanax  that  makes  _U  act  irrational?  #rhony
__label__m people  outchea  giving  patients  valium  and  cpz  at  the  same  time.  look  here.  i'm  glad  i'm  not  anywhere  near  that  cause  anyhow  people  dead....  lawsuit
__label__a u  think  it's  a  helpful  idea  to  take  ritalin  &  adderall  to  clean  until  it's  almost  4:30  am  and  ur  still  very  much  awake  🙂
__label__c when  you  have  to  take  a  xanax  first  thing  in  the  morning  because  people  are  already  testing  your  sanity
__label__c _U  _U  current  lee  have  a  60mg  prescription  for  vyvanse  pretty  hype  about  tht
__label__m _U  _U  Melody  needs  some  Xanax
__label__m ur  mcm  spells  xanax  with  a  z,  u  can  do  better  hun
__label__m if  you  offer  me  a  xanax  except  my  reply  to  be  fuck  off
__label__m _U  I'm  on  the  pill  and  still  getting  all  the  pain,  may  need  to  change  my  pill  or  just  get  a  lifetime  supply  of  morphine!
__label__m adderall  and  late  night  drives😶
__label__m _U  These  guys  has  serious  problems  lmao  too  much  of  nicotine  heroine  morphine  huh  😂😂
__label__m Y'all  need  to  stop  fucking  with  Xanax
__label__m _U  _U  Producing  morphine  ?
__label__m Why  did  someone  come  up  to  me  and  ask  if  i  sold  Xanax
__label__m _U    tamazepam,  zopiclone,  or  diazepam  (in  order  of  preference).  don't  take  with  alcohol.
__label__a friend  startled  me  today  after  telling  me  that  he  was  high  as  a  kite  after  taking  hydrocodone  (he  had  his  wisdom  teeth  removed  a  few  days  ago).  That  shit  is  addictive  as  fuck.  easy  to  get  dependent  on.
__label__m _U  With  the  ones  already  in  FL.  Morphine  and  GMS  are  crazy
__label__m _U  press  our  own  xan  we  call  it  alprazolam
__label__m I  need  Xanax  after  this  game
__label__m ok  ya  this  whole  debate  on  letting  my  sister  take  adderall  with  my  mom  isn't  doing  shit
__label__m suboxone  is  for  hardcore  drug  addicts.  it's  controversial  in  the  medical  field  as  it  allows  opiate(heroin)  addicts  to  withdrawal  w/o  pain.
__label__m _U  We  also  need  to  drink  to  the  deep  state  I  just  can’t  take  this  deep  state  narrative  anymore.    Quick,  Seroquel  for  the  house!

__label__m _U  _U  i'm  like  an  adderall    addicted  anaconda
__label__c _U  Nothing.  Well  the  only  thing  that  works  is  a  pill  called  seroquel  which  i  take  for  other  reasons  but  it  has  me  knocked  all  day.
__label__c Shouldnt  be  much  longer.  Thank  God  for  Valium.  Otherwise  I  would  have  been  sobbing  before  it  actually  happens.
__label__m _U  Mannnnnn  dude  acting  like  he  on  adderall  😂  🙄

__label__m My  27  yr  old  coworker  who  still  pops  Xanax  everyday  and  has  his  parents  pay  for  his  phone  bill,  called  me  immature  and  ignorant  for  not  agreeing  with  him  that  the  U.S.  was  the  greatest  country  to  live  in
__label__m people  who  assume  that  anyone  who  uses  xanax  is  an  addict  or  using  it  for  recreational  purposes  are  really  obnoxious
__label__m _U  We  heard  you  the  first  time...      take  a  Xanax
__label__c i  miss  diazepam  nd  feelin  comfortably  numb
__label__m tramadol  is  shit.

__label__c _U  They  gave  me  a  Valium  to  relax  and  I  honestly  wanted  to  fall  asleep.  They  made  me  super  comfy  and  it  was  over  in  20  min.
__label__m _U  Can’t  do  yoga.  Got  any  other  ideas  to  help  me  prevent  what  I  know  will  be  an  impulse  to  rip  off  either/or  Bruins  or  Lightning  heads,  depending  on  how  they  play?    Wish  I  had  some  Xanax.  Already  been  frustrated  today  from  negative  media  hype  re  Lightning!  🤬🤬🤬😡😡
__label__c Wow  lorazepam  just  hit  me  like  a  brick  of  sleepy
__label__m Who  meets  tear?  Could  it  be  Taehyung  who  still  suffers  from  the  trauma  of  what  he  has  done?  Maybe  Hoseok  with  his  adderall  addiction?  Jimin  and  his  depression?  Yoongi's  guilt?  Jungkook  finally  accepting  reality  and  it  breaking  him?  Maybe  Namjoon's  insecurities  eat  at  him?

__label__a _U  Man  U  shoulda  told  me  this!!  Lol  i  don’t  think  u  could  OD  off  NyQuil  or  Advil...?  I  took  10  hydrocodone  pills  once  n  all  it  did  was  get  me  hella  high  hoi  lol
__label__m "I  can't  even  write  a  rhyme  without  you  in  it.  My  Valium,  my  vaaaaalllliiuuuummmm~"  -  Eminem  😂😂
__label__m _U  pure  mdma  and  obviously  adderall  are  clean  and  really  not  comparable  to  meth.  but  cut  molly  is  more  often  than  not  actually  meth.
__label__m friend:  "i'm  tired  and  have  shit  to  do."  have  you  tried  adderall?  "ok  you  need  to  get  away  from  my  friend."  had  a  bad  time  on  adderall  huh?

__label__m _U  _U  He  just  wake  up  from  tracoma😂😂💔(tramadol  coma)
__label__a someone  sell  me  adderall  lol
__label__m _U  on  _U  talking  like  he's  on  Xanax  about  the  dire  situation  with  #NorthKorea.  What  a  #Loser.  #Resist  #TheResistance
__label__m I  like  the  way  Xanax  is  spelled.  It’s  a  palindrome  and  fun  to  read.  It’s  the  same  word  forwards  or  backwards.  And  to  me,  that’s  anxiety  relieving.
__label__c It's  awful  here  too.  I've  come  home  before  now  because  I've  needed  my  morphine  &  it's  taken  the  docs  hours  to  bother.  Walked  out.  Glad  they  gave  u  some  saline.  You  will  be  still  dry  with  losing  wat  u  had  in  you.  😢  Treatment  has  gone  to  pot.  No  care  or  compassion  anymore  xxx
__label__m _U  _U  The  sub/urban  impact  is  even  deeper,  here  in  Boston  there  is  an  area  called  "Methadone  Mile"  due  to  all  the  treatment  facilities  and  users  hanging  out  there.  But  most  of  the  users  in  that  area  are  from  outside  of  Boston.

__label__m you  cant  xanax  a  sickness  away.  the  world  is  seriously  in  need  of  a  sanity  campaign.
__label__m _U  yeah  i  think  that's  called  xanax
__label__a You  ever  take  adderall  instead  of  sleeping  cause  same
__label__m _U  i  can’t  watch.  needed  to  take  a  xanax.
__label__a ha  took  an  adderall  and  in  my  class  were  discussing  the  negative  effects  of  it
__label__m _U  _U  Who  knows  if  the  truck  driver  is  on  Tramadol  self.
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  The  entire  CT  delegation  is  powered  by  OxyContin  and  other  forms  of  drugs.
__label__m what  are  you  trying  to  say  when  you  buy  a  gold  xanax  charm?  lol
__label__m _U  _U  When  have  you  heard  of  someone  being  jailed  in  the  UK  for  having  tramadol?  Send  me  the  link.
__label__m @miss_sudo  bad  idea  !  effexor  is  not  like  xanax.  too  much  can  hurt  you.  seratonin  syndrome.  don't.

Going  to  take  some  of  my  dog’s  diazepam  (they  are  for  humans  but  the  vets  have  him  on  it  for  his  separation  anxiety)  and  go  to  bed...
__label__m boyfriend  caught  sneaking  oxycodone  and  pure  liquid  fentanyl  into  prison  for  his  girlfriend,  says  albany  county  sheriff  _U
__label__a Washing  down  a  second  klonopin  with  wine...    Why  yes,  it  IS  time  for  a  social  engagement.  Why  do  you  ask?
__label__c this  10  mg  adderall  really  isn't  doing  anything  for  me  right  now  wtf
__label__a haven't  slept  in  3  days,  took  adderall  today,  currently  lying    in  bed  &  can't  move
__label__m Tramadol  is  a  scary  drug
__label__m difference  between  oxycodone  hcl  and  oxycontin  withdrawal  symptoms
__label__m have  unwanted  hair  growth?you  probably  have  munchausen  by  proxy.this  causes  denial.try  abilify
__label__m Legalize  everything.  Put  hard  drugs  in  clinics  like  methadone.  Drives  cost  down,  stops  drug  related  crimes,  kids  won’t  have  access  because  no  one  will  smuggle  worthless  powder.  No  new  addicts  in  about  5  years.  You  rarely  see  methadone  on  the  street  and  if  it  were  cheap  u  wouldn’t
__label__m we  must  imagine  sisyphus  on  lorazepam
__label__m _U  Tramadol:  what's  the  problem,  officer?
__label__m how  much  valium  will  i  need  for  next  weeks  episode?  #talkingdead  _U
__label__c never  have  i  seen  a  more  dissapointed  look  on  my  parents'  faces  than  when  i  just  brought  up  the  idea  of  buying  adderall  to  help  me  focus  😬
__label__m _U  _U  My  dog  has  a  refillable  Xanax  prescription  that  ,,,well,,,
__label__m •  Two  hours  ago  he  used  Valium  (masking  meth  abusing)...  WHEREAS  I  though  I  was  part  of  a  TEAM  waiting  for  him  to  defecate  *NOT*  constipate.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  yes,  that  i  have,  i  always  have  ativan  on  hand.  i  have  seizures  that  they  work  wonders.

__label__m _U  That  would  be  a  Xanax  mistake  ma'am
__label__m _U  I  suggest  a  Xanax  for  anxiety  nights.  hahha
__label__a _U  well  i  want  something  because  xanax  fucking  suck  i  just  get  addicted  and  even  more  sad
__label__m That  pain  killer  is  more  potent  than  Morphine  alone...and  he  mixed  it  with  heroin...  These  kids  man...
__label__m One  woman  with  addicted  family  members  felt  it  was  better  to  "sweat  it  out"  going  through  detox  without  meds.  Another  person  in  recovery  talked  about  a  culture  of  continued  drug  use  around  methadone  clinics,  saying  she  robbed  a  bank,  used  various  substances  during  her  days  at  one
__label__m _U  Adderall  ✅  A  glass  of  whiskey  ✅  Diesel  Jeans  ✅
__label__c _U  It  happened  to  me  that  I  was  on  morphine  only  for  3  months  for  chronic  pain  from  ACDF  surgery  that  failed,  the  doctor  was  late  getting  the  info  the  insurance  co  needed  so  the  insurance  co  declined  approval  I  had  to  stop  cold  turkey,  wasn't  fun.
__label__m _U  _U  A  Floridian  mate  had  an  injury-  here  he  would  have  had  a  CT,  &  been  referred  to  a  specialist.  There?  Nope.  OxyContin  &  see  how  it  goes.
__label__c anxiety  &  adderall  are  not  a  good  combo
__label__m no  xanax  bars  or  vicodin
__label__m _U  i  thought  of  the  working  woman  vibe  as  an  adderall  booster  but  it  was  probably  more  of  a  side  effect.
__label__m all  long  beach  hoes  wanna  do  is  drink  four  lokos  ,  noz  it  ,  pop  xanax  and  look  for  plots  😂💯
__label__c _U  i  dont  trust  it  .  ive  had  one  of  my  hands  on  my  xanax  bottle  since  i  read  tht  danothy  tweet

__label__m unwieldy  abomination/monster:  pls  kill  me  Me:  give  it  a  xanax  it  should  be  fine
__label__m Hey  I  love  you.  You're  the  most  important  person  in  the  world  to  me.  Your  existence  is  my  daily  dose  of  dopamine,  so  if  you  leave  me,  know  that  I'll  be  alright  with  my  morphine  while  watching  you,  happy  with  someone  else.  Atleast  one  of  us  is  happy☺
__label__a _U  I'm  on  hydrocodone  so  I'm  floating.  It's  getting  pulled  Tuesday  though.
__label__m _U  In  other  news.  Rush  Limbaugh  received  his  monthly  supply  of  OxyContin  via  his  undocumented  housekeeper.  &lt;—-  true  story,  folks
__label__c _U  Given  my  history  with  Lyrica  and  Gabapentin,  I'm  kind  of  boggled  that  I've  got  so  few  reactions  to  the  Tegretol,  but  maybe  because  it's  stronger  so  I  can  take  it  at  a  lower  dose?
__label__c my  family  says  every  time  they  eat  i  ask  to  smell  their  food  and  then  cry...i've  been  living  off  of  oxycodone  &  popsicles  for  too  long
__label__c but  this  adderall  got  me  still  all  here  tho
__label__c _U  Try  half  a  tramadol.    That's  all  I  need  and  you're  way  smaller  than  me!  It's  great  when  it  works!
__label__a No  idea  how  I'm  still  awake  right  now...  100mg  of  Tramadol  and  a  couple  of  doubles  of  bourbon  should've  had  me  in  a  relaxation  coma.
__label__c Woke  up  with  a  horrible  stiff  neck  (due  to  my  scoliosis)  with  the  pain  radiating  down  to  my  arm  already.  Took  Tramadol  to  ease  it  out  (as  I’ve  been  prescribed  before)  and  now  I  feel  woozy  hahaha    Apparently  in  some  parts  of  the  world,  Tramadol  is  abused  as  an  opioid
__label__c This  semester  is  almost  over  and  I  haven’t  taken  adderall  once  .  Big  accomplishment
__label__m _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  _U  the  same  101  women  -  59  had  =&lt;  10mg  oxycodone  IR  in  first  24h
__label__m word?  rt  _U:  lance  gonna  get  sleepy  when  his  adderall  &  red  bull  leave  his  system  mid  way  through  4th
__label__c _U  I  was  on  a  relatively  low  dose  of  adderall  last  year  for  narcolepsy,  and  I  don't  even  think  I  made  it  three  weeks.  I  was  basically  drowsy  and  realllllly  overstimulated  at  the  same  time  it  was  awful.  -_-
__label__a _U  yeah  its  shit-i  should  have  known  i  was  getting  manic  today.  i  took  a  valium  and  drinking  my  way  through  it  :-(
__label__c Seroquel  has  been  making  me  gain  weight  for  a  long  time.  Do  I  stop  taking  it,  throw  my  guts  up  from  not  having  it.    Or  keep  taking  it  and  gain  a  thousand  pounds  and  be  fatter  than  I  already  am.  I’m  fucking  20  pounds  heavier  than  I  was  two  years  ago.  Ridiculous.  I’m  so  gross.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  It  isn't  rhe  best  .  Thank  God  for  imitrex  and  hydrocodone  but  they  don't  work  all  the  time.
__label__m My  phone  autocorrects  tramadol  to  "tram  adolescents"  ???

__label__a pop  an  adderall  and  catch  up  💀
__label__m _U  She  not  be  taking  her  state  issued  OxyContin  vitamins  properly.    We  who  reside  in  West  Virginia  are  far  too  strung  out  to  see  how  fucked  we  truly  are  by  coal  and  fracking.    Take  yr  medicine,  sister.    Make  you  feel  better.
__label__m 😂😂😂  rt  _U:  food  is  so  fucking  good  when  you're  not  on  adderall
__label__m _U  woo  wee  or  nicotine  heroin  morphine
__label__c _U  Here  are  the  medicines  which  really  helped  me.  1)  Pregabalin    2)  Tizanidine
__label__a me  being  able  to  function  on  xanax  quickly  turned  into  taking  xanax  when  i  woke  up.  when  i  went  to  work.  when  i  went  to  school.
__label__m My  PM  doc  said  w/suboxone  &  SUBUTEX    its  more  important  to  disclose  all  the  meds  u  take.    They're  replacing      methadone  as  the  1st      course  of  treatment.  He  doesn't  like  em;  studies  report  they  too  can  be  addicted.  (CMS,  that  $299  he  bills  u  4?  I  get  my  $  worth,  he  gets    $105.)
__label__a who's  tryna  roll  thru  with  some  valium  for  me  ??  asking  for  a  friend
__label__m Was  working  in  a  methadone  clinic  man's  addicted  to  heroin,  £50  a  day  to  prevent  withdrawing.  Turn  to  crime  to  continue  to  fund  a  addiction.
__label__m just  like    nicotine  heroine  morphine  you're  all  i  need,  yeah  all  i  need
__label__c my  little  sister  keeps  screaming  something  about  alexander  hamilton  and  shots  i'm  trying  not  to  pop  a  xanax
__label__u _U  im  sorry  the  mv  is  really  hetero  and  sk  are  the  lyrica
__label__a if  anyone  wants  to  send  me  tramadol  i  would  love  you  forever...  my  nerve  damage  has  flared  up  so  bad  on  my  back  i  can't  walk  again  😭💔  fml
__label__m _U  I  don't  think  it's  anything  other  the  normal  dose  of  OxyContin  all  of  us  NRA  members  take  before  shooting
__label__u l'morphine  vs  PAUSE  FLOW    =        L'MORPHO  #WIN
__label__m not  born  yesterday,  indeed  pre-existing  conditions  opioid  epidemic  excuse  the  sterotype:  'oxycodine  soccer  moms  of  the  OC'  Afghanistan  is  home  to  Opium  Fields    concerned  e.g.  North  Hollywood  shootout  concerned  opium  played  a  role  in  the  shootout
__label__m stop  being  a  fucking  asshole  &  just  write  the  damned  prescriptions  for  some  oxycodone,  ventolin  hfa,  advair  diskus  250/50  &  stool  softeners!
__label__m _U  _U  _U  more  profitable  to  Big  Pharma  if  DT's  push  dangerous  Lyrica  on  chronic  pain  patients  then  if  opioids  given.  6/
__label__m _U  Alcohol  is  worse  and  kills  a  shit  ton  more  people.  Morphine  is  what  your  body  breaks  codeine  down  into  which  is  in  the  syrup  he  drinks.  Every  smart  person(me)  sounds  stupid  to  people  who  can’t  comprehend  what’s  being  said  (you)
__label__c _U  i  just  took  a  xanax  and  i  can  barely  keep  my  eyes  open
__label__m Stay  woke.  Can't  be  sleepin'.  Not  even  a  cat  nap.  Gotta  keep  your  eyes  open.  Take  some  Adderall  if  you  need  to.  But  stay  woke.
__label__c _U  great.  going  onto  lithium  now  and  that  will  allow  me  to  reduce  some  of  the  other  drugs  i'm  on  like  epilim  and  zyprexa  😃
__label__m has  anyone  done  the  'now  we  know  what  bgt  stands  for'  joke  yet?  britain's  got  tramadol  ...

__label__m _U  Jim  gives  an  expression  of  feigned  disbelief.  "Excuse  you,  my  tits  would  look  amazing  in  scrubs."  He  says  in  an  offended  tone,  before  grinning.  "I'm  a  /very/  generous  nurse.  That's  time-release  Morphine.  You're  set  for  the  rest  of  the  night."

__label__m adderall  is  the  best  pills  for  adhd  i  swear
__label__m _U  I  agree.  These  kind  of  drugs  are  like  a  plague  when  they  go  on  the  black  market.  It's  practically  morphine  and  destroys  people's  lives.
__label__m [  diet  &  fitness  ]  open  question  :  adderall  for  weight  loss?:  so  i  know  this  isn't  the  smartest  thing  to  do,  but  don't  give  ****.  if  you...
__label__m #findingdory  is  an  emotional  ride  that  requires  klonopin  before  and  after  the  film  🐠😪
__label__m _U  Thank  you.  Gabapentin  is  also  increasing  Opiate  ODs  by  50%  CNS  &  Respiratory  all  for  a  .5  gain  to  reduce  Opiate  &  doesn't  impact  pain
__label__c thank  god  for  vyvanse  lol

__label__c adderall  singlehandedly  improved  my  relationship  with  my  father
__label__c i  accidentally  just  took  my  moms  oxycontin  instead  of  my  anxiety  meds  im  dead
__label__m i  didn't  even  do  adderall  last  night  like  all  you  crazies  and  i  still  haven't  slept  yet,  plus  i  had  to  go  to  work
__label__c How  many  Xanax  am  I  going  to  have  to  take  in  the  series  of  excruciating  phone  calls  it  takes  me  to  get  a  refill  of  Xanax.
__label__a (june  2014):  i  find  a  bottle  of  hydrocodone  and  this  time  i'm  really  frightened  bc  i  got  so  high  that  i  never  came  down.  i  can't  explain  it.
__label__c _U's  mission  statement:  don't  just  get  people's  money,  make  them  have  suffer  to  give  it  to  you.    Literally  needed  an  ativan  because  I  wanted  to  pay  my  bill.
__label__m ritalin  and  adderall  prozac  and  xanax-  what  a  sad  world  we  live  in.
__label__m today  is  brought  to  you  by  adderall
__label__c _U  after  that  long  was  afraid  of  being  on  them  for  the  rest  of  my  life.  so  i  just  take  lyrica  and  kinda  live  with  it.
__label__c _U  _U  _U  Wine?  I'm  about  to  run  out  of  valium.  Thank  god  i  have  a  understanding  doctor

__label__c _U  my  doc  just  put  me  on  geodon  but  i’ve  also  been  on  abilify  in  the  past
__label__a my  prof  almost  made  me  fall  asleep  even  after  i  chugged  an  energy  drink.  only  adderall  can  save  me
__label__c The  point  in  my  life  when  I  was  prescribed  three  Ativan  a  day  was  a  weird  time
__label__m til  that  theodore  roosevelt  carried  a  lethal  does  of  morphine  with  him  on  all  his  adventures,  and  he  almost  used  it  in  the  amazon  #todayile…
__label__c _U  yea  they  prescribed  me  some  oxycodone
__label__a and  yes  you’d  assume  most  restaurants  have  wine,  but  with  their  shitty  white  trash  taste  the  lunch  could  end  up  being  at  some  hick  diner  with  trash  in  the  isles.  gonna  bring  along  xanax  for  backup.
__label__m _U  Cats  (pets  in  general)  are  the  healthy  equivalent  of  Valium.  I  have  two  bunnies,  Ruben  and  Hansel.

__label__m _U  _U  _U  Your  full  of  shit  this  Valium
__label__c my  doctor  fought  for  me  and  advocated  for  me.  lyrica  has  to  be  a  last  resort  or  my  insurance  won't  cover  it.
__label__a 3  adderall  in  my  stomach  bye
__label__c _U  Don't  know.  Been  crying  all  night.  I  feel  like  I  was  violated.  It  was  at  least  4  men,  with  absolutely  no  written  notice  used  the  manager  key  and  just  came  in  when  I  was  in  the  bathtub.  I  can't  think  straight  I  took  Xanax  but  they  need  to  pay  for  what  they  did  &  IDK  how.
__label__m 50p  says  you  were  pissed  when  you  had  your  accident,  lady.  Another  50p  says  you're  off  your  tits  on  tramadol
__label__c how  the  heck  am  i  supposed  to  take  hydrocodone  on  an  empty  stomach  ?!!?
__label__m Then  they  have  hydrocodone  .....  I'm  not  taking  that  shit
__label__m _U  Anybody  got  any  statistics  on  increase  in  Xanax  sales  since  last  Nov  9?

__label__c _U  that's  such  a  pain.  i  need  prior  auth  for  my  lyrica
__label__m I  want  to  go  to  Facebook  because  someone  was  like  why'd  he  send  me  an  OxyContin  on  Sunday.
__label__u _U  look  at  what  lyrica  just  said  a  few  minutes  ago...
__label__m _U  Shit  dude,  I  think  she's  beyond  white  sage  and  bible  verses.    What  we  need  is  like  Consecrated  water  from  the  Dead  Sea  A  five-pound  block  of  incense  infused  with  Dragon's  Blood  oil  And  a  cocktail  of  Xanax  and  'shrooms.    Nothing  short  of  that  will  help  this  poor  soul.
__label__m _U  "increasingly,  experts  fear  that  babies  are  being  removed  from  mothers  they  need  so  they  can  get  morphine  they  do  not."
__label__c I  do  still  have  my  tramadol  script  that  I  already  have  to  take  for  my  back.    Its  helping.    But  they  prescribed  oxy.    No  fucking  thanks.    Anything  a  friend  or  family  member  has  tried  to  kill  over  I  wont  fuck  with.    Also  cant  take  ibuprofine  cause  if  the  surgery.    Bleh.
__label__c i've  always  wanted  to  try  xanax  but  i'm  scared
__label__a I  am  so  deep  into  B99—thank  you  Heineken,  klonopin,  Woodford  Reserve,  10  hour  flight
__label__c I  made  a  mistake  in  not  taking  the  seroquel  last  night  and  now  I'm  dying
__label__m ALERT!  FDA  has  warned  that  children  and  adolescents  should  not  be  prescribed  cough  and  cold  medicines  containing  codeine  and  hydrocodone  because  of  serious  safety  risks  posed  by  the  opioid  ingredients.
