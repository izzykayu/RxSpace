## SM4H - Team **RxSpace**!
*This repository contains code for tackling Task 4 of the SMM2020 

The Social Media Mining for Health Applications (#SMM4H) Shared Task involves natural language processing (NLP) challenges of using social media data for health research, including informal, colloquial expressions and misspellings of clinical concepts, noise, data sparsity, ambiguity, and multilingual posts. For each of the five tasks below, participating teams will be provided with a set of annotated tweets for developing systems, followed by a three-day window during which they will run their systems on unlabeled test data and upload the predictions of their systems to CodaLab. Informlsation about registration, data access, paper submissions, and presentations can be found below.

*Task 4: Automatic characterization of chatter related to prescription medication abuse in tweets* <br>

This new, multi-class classification task involves distinguishing, among tweets that mention at least one prescription opioid, benzodiazepine, atypical anti-psychotic, central nervous system stimulant or GABA analogue, tweets that report potential abuse/misuse (annotated as “A”) from those that report non-abuse/-misuse consumption (annotated as “C”), merely mention the medication (annotated as “M”), or are unrelated (annotated as “U”)3. <br>

#### Timeline
* Training data available: January 15, 2020 (may be sooner for some tasks) <br>
* Test data available: April 2, 2020 <br>
System predictions for test data due: April 5, 2020 (23:59 CodaLab server time) <br>
* System description paper submission deadline: May 5, 2020 <br>
* Notification of acceptance of system description papers: June 10, 2020 <br>
* Camera-ready papers due: June 30, 2020 <br>
* Workshop: September 13, 2020 <br>
* All deadlines, except for system predictions (see above), are 23:59 UTC (“anywhere on Earth”). <br>
